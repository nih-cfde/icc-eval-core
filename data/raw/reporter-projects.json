Many of the current search techniques depend on data descriptors which differ\nacross CF programs and may be incomplete or inaccurate. Many of these experiments output lists of\ngenes significant to certain biomedical conditions. We are proposing to use these gene lists to find\nsimilar data sets. This approach will not only enable searching across CF data sets but also can connect\nthem to other experiments in other databases and biomedical catalogs, e.g., databases containing\ndisease-gene associations and molecular pathways. To achieve this aim, we will implement an efficient\nlinear algorithm to calculate similarities between large numbers of gene sets. Our prototype tool,\nDBRetina, uses this algorithm to build huge similarity networks in few minutes using minimal\ncomputational resources. DBRetina serves as the foundation for CurIndex, a study similarity graph\ndatabase that connects multiple health-related resources. DBRetina and CurIndex will allow advanced\nsearch for related CF experiments and facilitate better interpretation of biomedical data.",

Moreover, these tools will be\nable to provide new insights for meta-analysis by testing for the collective enrichment of related\nexperimental profiles. The resulting enhanced discoverability of CF data sets will support the large scale\nmeta-analysis studies needed to address complex biomedical questions.",

      "abstract_text": "Detailed Engagement Plan\nThe National Institutes of Health Common Fund’s Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx) project was\nlaunched in 2010 with a goal of providing the scientific community with a resource for the study of human\ngene expression and regulation across multiple tissues, to specifically provide insights into the mechanisms\nof gene regulation and disease-related perturbations, and to further our understanding of the role that\ninherited genetic variation plays in susceptibility to complex diseases. The project enrolled 960 recently\ndeceased, adult donors and collected close to 49,000 tissue samples. Core data generation was\ncompleted at the end of 2017, with the primary data types including whole genome (WGS, 30X) and whole\nexome (WES, 100X) sequence data on all donors, and RNA-sequence data from at least 25,000 samples\nspanning 53 human tissues/organs. This dataset constitutes the largest multi-tissue RNA sequence data\nresource generated to date (a previous study of genetic effects on gene expression, TwinsUK/EUROBATS,\ngenerated ~2,700 RNA-seq samples from four accessible tissue sites). The GTEx resource also includes\na rich and well annotated collection of donor, sample, and experiment metadata. Furthermore, additional\nmolecular data types, aimed at enhancing the core data sets, are still being produced, including mass\nspectrometry-based proteomics, measurements of DNA methylation, histone marks (ChIP-seq), somatic\nDNA sequencing, and DNase I hypersensitivity sites.\nThe GTEx resource includes both protected-access and open-access data (Fig. 1). The protected-access\ndata include extensive sample, subject and technical metadata and raw sequence BAM files from RNAseq,\nwhole genome (WGS) and whole exome (WES) sequencing, ChIP-seq and m6A RNA-seq, as well as\nprotected data derived from these such as genotype calls in VCF format. An approved dbGaP application\nis required to obtain all protected-access data, including access to the raw sequence data, which are\naccessible on the AnVIL platform (on Google Cloud Platform; GCP). The GTEx data also include a large\namount of open-access data, such as gene and transcript expression quantifications, cis- and trans-expression\nand splicing QTLs, histology images of every tissue, some eGTEx data summaries, the sample\nbiobank, and a very limited set of de-identified sample and subject metadata. All of these public data are\navailable for download, and as interactive visualizations and summary tables on the GTEx portal.\nThe GTEx project has developed an extensive suite of tools and analysis pipelines that have been\nbenchmarked, optimized and implemented in GCP for the project (such as the RNA-seq alignment,\nquantification, and QC pipeline, and the QTL analysis pipeline). These pipelines were also selected by the\nTOPMed project to produce a harmonized resource of RNA sequence data across the large number of\ncohorts being sequenced for that project (>20,000 samples to date); our team was involved in initial\nbenchmarking and harmonization tests of our pipeline across TOPMed sequencing centers and are actively\ninvolved in ongoing data production and analyses. Moreover, very similar pipelines are used by the\nENCODE project, thus facilitating comparisons across large datasets that would be prohibitive in terms of\ncosts and computational resources in the absence of harmonized pipelines. We have also created\nnumerous visualizations developed specifically for the open access data on the GTEx portal. The GTEx\nproject has a very large user community: the GTEx data have the second largest number of Data Access\nRequests for protected data in dbGaP (behind TCGA), and it is the most frequently downloaded dbGaP\nproject. An even larger number of users access the data, tools and interactive visualizations on the GTEx\nportal: in the 2019 calendar year, the GTEx portal had 135,000 users (~12,000-18,000/month) worldwide,\nwith users spiking in October 2019 following the release of the V8 data. The GTEx consortium has published\nnumerous papers describing the dataset and analyses of the data, and two additional data releases are\nstill planned.",

      "abstract_text": "Detailed Engagement Plan\nThe National Institutes of Health Common Fund’s Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx) project was\nlaunched in 2010 with a goal of providing the scientific community with a resource for the study of human\ngene expression and regulation across multiple tissues, to specifically provide insights into the mechanisms\nof gene regulation and disease-related perturbations, and to further our understanding of the role that\ninherited genetic variation plays in susceptibility to complex diseases. The project enrolled 960 recently\ndeceased, adult donors and collected close to 49,000 tissue samples. Core data generation was\ncompleted at the end of 2017, with the primary data types including whole genome (WGS, 30X) and whole\nexome (WES, 100X) sequence data on all donors, and RNA-sequence data from at least 25,000 samples\nspanning 53 human tissues/organs. This dataset constitutes the largest multi-tissue RNA sequence data\nresource generated to date (a previous study of genetic effects on gene expression, TwinsUK/EUROBATS,\ngenerated ~2,700 RNA-seq samples from four accessible tissue sites). The GTEx resource also includes\na rich and well annotated collection of donor, sample, and experiment metadata. Furthermore, additional\nmolecular data types, aimed at enhancing the core data sets, are still being produced, including mass\nspectrometry-based proteomics, measurements of DNA methylation, histone marks (ChIP-seq), somatic\nDNA sequencing, and DNase I hypersensitivity sites.\nThe GTEx resource includes both protected-access and open-access data (Fig. 1). The protected-access\ndata include extensive sample, subject and technical metadata and raw sequence BAM files from RNAseq,\nwhole genome (WGS) and whole exome (WES) sequencing, ChIP-seq and m6A RNA-seq, as well as\nprotected data derived from these such as genotype calls in VCF format. An approved dbGaP application\nis required to obtain all protected-access data, including access to the raw sequence data, which are\naccessible on the AnVIL platform (on Google Cloud Platform; GCP). The GTEx data also include a large\namount of open-access data, such as gene and transcript expression quantifications, cis- and trans-expression\nand splicing QTLs, histology images of every tissue, some eGTEx data summaries, the sample\nbiobank, and a very limited set of de-identified sample and subject metadata. All of these public data are\navailable for download, and as interactive visualizations and summary tables on the GTEx portal.\nThe GTEx project has developed an extensive suite of tools and analysis pipelines that have been\nbenchmarked, optimized and implemented in GCP for the project (such as the RNA-seq alignment,\nquantification, and QC pipeline, and the QTL analysis pipeline). These pipelines were also selected by the\nTOPMed project to produce a harmonized resource of RNA sequence data across the large number of\ncohorts being sequenced for that project (>20,000 samples to date); our team was involved in initial\nbenchmarking and harmonization tests of our pipeline across TOPMed sequencing centers and are actively\ninvolved in ongoing data production and analyses. Moreover, very similar pipelines are used by the\nENCODE project, thus facilitating comparisons across large datasets that would be prohibitive in terms of\ncosts and computational resources in the absence of harmonized pipelines. We have also created\nnumerous visualizations developed specifically for the open access data on the GTEx portal. The GTEx\nproject has a very large user community: the GTEx data have the second largest number of Data Access\nRequests for protected data in dbGaP (behind TCGA), and it is the most frequently downloaded dbGaP\nproject. An even larger number of users access the data, tools and interactive visualizations on the GTEx\nportal: in the 2019 calendar year, the GTEx portal had 135,000 users (~12,000-18,000/month) worldwide,\nwith users spiking in October 2019 following the release of the V8 data. The GTEx consortium has published\nnumerous papers describing the dataset and analyses of the data, and two additional data releases are\nstill planned.",

      "abstract_text": "Detailed Engagement Plan\nThe National Institutes of Health Common Fund’s Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx) project was\nlaunched in 2010 with a goal of providing the scientific community with a resource for the study of human\ngene expression and regulation across multiple tissues, to specifically provide insights into the mechanisms\nof gene regulation and disease-related perturbations, and to further our understanding of the role that\ninherited genetic variation plays in susceptibility to complex diseases. The project enrolled 960 recently\ndeceased, adult donors and collected close to 49,000 tissue samples. Core data generation was\ncompleted at the end of 2017, with the primary data types including whole genome (WGS, 30X) and whole\nexome (WES, 100X) sequence data on all donors, and RNA-sequence data from at least 25,000 samples\nspanning 53 human tissues/organs. This dataset constitutes the largest multi-tissue RNA sequence data\nresource generated to date (a previous study of genetic effects on gene expression, TwinsUK/EUROBATS,\ngenerated ~2,700 RNA-seq samples from four accessible tissue sites). The GTEx resource also includes\na rich and well annotated collection of donor, sample, and experiment metadata. Furthermore, additional\nmolecular data types, aimed at enhancing the core data sets, are still being produced, including mass\nspectrometry-based proteomics, measurements of DNA methylation, histone marks (ChIP-seq), somatic\nDNA sequencing, and DNase I hypersensitivity sites.\nThe GTEx resource includes both protected-access and open-access data (Fig. 1). The protected-access\ndata include extensive sample, subject and technical metadata and raw sequence BAM files from RNAseq,\nwhole genome (WGS) and whole exome (WES) sequencing, ChIP-seq and m6A RNA-seq, as well as\nprotected data derived from these such as genotype calls in VCF format. An approved dbGaP application\nis required to obtain all protected-access data, including access to the raw sequence data, which are\naccessible on the AnVIL platform (on Google Cloud Platform; GCP). The GTEx data also include a large\namount of open-access data, such as gene and transcript expression quantifications, cis- and trans-expression\nand splicing QTLs, histology images of every tissue, some eGTEx data summaries, the sample\nbiobank, and a very limited set of de-identified sample and subject metadata. All of these public data are\navailable for download, and as interactive visualizations and summary tables on the GTEx portal.\nThe GTEx project has developed an extensive suite of tools and analysis pipelines that have been\nbenchmarked, optimized and implemented in GCP for the project (such as the RNA-seq alignment,\nquantification, and QC pipeline, and the QTL analysis pipeline). These pipelines were also selected by the\nTOPMed project to produce a harmonized resource of RNA sequence data across the large number of\ncohorts being sequenced for that project (>20,000 samples to date); our team was involved in initial\nbenchmarking and harmonization tests of our pipeline across TOPMed sequencing centers and are actively\ninvolved in ongoing data production and analyses. Moreover, very similar pipelines are used by the\nENCODE project, thus facilitating comparisons across large datasets that would be prohibitive in terms of\ncosts and computational resources in the absence of harmonized pipelines. We have also created\nnumerous visualizations developed specifically for the open access data on the GTEx portal. The GTEx\nproject has a very large user community: the GTEx data have the second largest number of Data Access\nRequests for protected data in dbGaP (behind TCGA), and it is the most frequently downloaded dbGaP\nproject. An even larger number of users access the data, tools and interactive visualizations on the GTEx\nportal: in the 2019 calendar year, the GTEx portal had 135,000 users (~12,000-18,000/month) worldwide,\nwith users spiking in October 2019 following the release of the V8 data. The GTEx consortium has published\nnumerous papers describing the dataset and analyses of the data, and two additional data releases are\nstill planned.",

      "abstract_text": "Detailed Engagement Plan\nThe National Institutes of Health Common Fund’s Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx) project was\nlaunched in 2010 with a goal of providing the scientific community with a resource for the study of human\ngene expression and regulation across multiple tissues, to specifically provide insights into the mechanisms\nof gene regulation and disease-related perturbations, and to further our understanding of the role that\ninherited genetic variation plays in susceptibility to complex diseases. The project enrolled 960 recently\ndeceased, adult donors and collected close to 49,000 tissue samples. Core data generation was\ncompleted at the end of 2017, with the primary data types including whole genome (WGS, 30X) and whole\nexome (WES, 100X) sequence data on all donors, and RNA-sequence data from at least 25,000 samples\nspanning 53 human tissues/organs. This dataset constitutes the largest multi-tissue RNA sequence data\nresource generated to date (a previous study of genetic effects on gene expression, TwinsUK/EUROBATS,\ngenerated ~2,700 RNA-seq samples from four accessible tissue sites). The GTEx resource also includes\na rich and well annotated collection of donor, sample, and experiment metadata. Furthermore, additional\nmolecular data types, aimed at enhancing the core data sets, are still being produced, including mass\nspectrometry-based proteomics, measurements of DNA methylation, histone marks (ChIP-seq), somatic\nDNA sequencing, and DNase I hypersensitivity sites.\nThe GTEx resource includes both protected-access and open-access data (Fig. 1). The protected-access\ndata include extensive sample, subject and technical metadata and raw sequence BAM files from RNAseq,\nwhole genome (WGS) and whole exome (WES) sequencing, ChIP-seq and m6A RNA-seq, as well as\nprotected data derived from these such as genotype calls in VCF format. An approved dbGaP application\nis required to obtain all protected-access data, including access to the raw sequence data, which are\naccessible on the AnVIL platform (on Google Cloud Platform; GCP). The GTEx data also include a large\namount of open-access data, such as gene and transcript expression quantifications, cis- and trans-expression\nand splicing QTLs, histology images of every tissue, some eGTEx data summaries, the sample\nbiobank, and a very limited set of de-identified sample and subject metadata. All of these public data are\navailable for download, and as interactive visualizations and summary tables on the GTEx portal.\nThe GTEx project has developed an extensive suite of tools and analysis pipelines that have been\nbenchmarked, optimized and implemented in GCP for the project (such as the RNA-seq alignment,\nquantification, and QC pipeline, and the QTL analysis pipeline). These pipelines were also selected by the\nTOPMed project to produce a harmonized resource of RNA sequence data across the large number of\ncohorts being sequenced for that project (>20,000 samples to date); our team was involved in initial\nbenchmarking and harmonization tests of our pipeline across TOPMed sequencing centers and are actively\ninvolved in ongoing data production and analyses. Moreover, very similar pipelines are used by the\nENCODE project, thus facilitating comparisons across large datasets that would be prohibitive in terms of\ncosts and computational resources in the absence of harmonized pipelines. We have also created\nnumerous visualizations developed specifically for the open access data on the GTEx portal. The GTEx\nproject has a very large user community: the GTEx data have the second largest number of Data Access\nRequests for protected data in dbGaP (behind TCGA), and it is the most frequently downloaded dbGaP\nproject. An even larger number of users access the data, tools and interactive visualizations on the GTEx\nportal: in the 2019 calendar year, the GTEx portal had 135,000 users (~12,000-18,000/month) worldwide,\nwith users spiking in October 2019 following the release of the V8 data. The GTEx consortium has published\nnumerous papers describing the dataset and analyses of the data, and two additional data releases are\nstill planned.",

      "abstract_text": "Abstract\nGenome-wide association studies (GWAS) have highlighted that disease-associated human genetic variants are\nprevalent in noncoding regions and for most of them the biological function or gene target remain\nuncharacterized. To better annotate such disease variants, NIH-funded consortia created comprehensive maps\nof putative regulatory elements and identified SNPs associated with gene expression (eQTLs) for different\ntissues and primary cell types. In parallel, breakthroughs in capturing the 3D genome structure have\ndemonstrated the importance of cell-type-specific physical proximity between genes and their regulatory\nelements. This 3D view provided a new way through which disease-associations of certain variants can be\nexplained. There is an increasing interest in utilization of chromatin loops for GWAS variant annotation, however,\nto the best of our knowledge, there is no comprehensive study incorporating eQTL data and high-resolution\nchromatin looping information across many different matched/related cell types and tissues to interpret GWAS\nvariants identified for a large set of diseases. To goal of this proposal is to utilize NIH Common Fund datasets\n(GTEx and 4D Nucleome) as well as other published chromatin loop and eQTL data to carry out different\nintegrative approaches for better annotation of disease-associated genetic variants. This will lead to the\ndevelopment of a framework and best practices for integrative analysis of loops, eQTLs and GWAS signals. The\ndeveloped framework will be tested on a large number of diseases and disease-relevant cell types to create a\nsubstantial online resource for researchers. For a subset of the studied diseases, for which we have ongoing\nresearch interests, we will further analyze the identified novel genes, genetic variants and overlapping regulatory\nelements to determine potential targets that warrant further investigation.",

The proposed program is designed to expand and diversify the pipeline\nof new investigators in biomedical research. The program will include an intensive, two-week, in-person\nbootcamp course at UC San Diego designed around providing hands-on instructional guidance for using data\nfrom two Common Fund Programs, Bridge2AI and SPARC, as well as the NIH All of Us Research Program.\nJointly, these datasets provide a multimodal set of data (e.g. electronic health records [EHRs], imaging data,\nwaveform data, omics data) and offer great potential to train participants of the program in analyzing large\ncomplex datasets across multiple disciplines (diabetes research, neuromodulation, biology, etc.). This program\nwill be led by an interdisciplinary team with a wide range of research expertise and a strong track record of\ntraining, education, and mentorship. Participants will be graduate students, medical students, postdoctoral\nfellows, and early career faculty (early stage investigators). They will engage in virtual didactic instruction both\nbefore and after the bootcamp. The program includes a strong mentoring component, with faculty mentors\nproviding input on designing and executing projects using the NIH-supported datasets. During the bootcamp,\nparticipants will complete projects in small groups and deliver oral presentations to discuss their results. The\neducational program will include instruction on accessing and analyzing these datasets as well as in rigor and\nreproducibility, responsible conduct of research, team science principles, and the practical aspects of\nconducting large-scale, multi-disciplinary scientific collaborations. Innovations in this program include\nleveraging real-life datasets, emphasizing multimodal analyses, and providing intensive guidance in a focused\nformat accessible to a broad array of participants, including clinician-scientists. The program will support\nparticipants as they pursue publication and presentation opportunities to advance their careers. Broad\noutreach will be conducted to enable diverse recruitment, and intensive program evaluation will be conducted\nto facilitate iterative improvements to the syllabus and program administration. Program faculty include leaders\nof the NIH-supported datasets being taught. By completing these aims, we will promote the broad and rigorous\nuse of Common Fund and other NIH-supported data among diverse participants in the formative stages of their\ncareers and help facilitate their advancement toward independent research careers and to becoming long-term\nusers of NIH datasets.",

This rhythmic pattern presents opportunities for time-dependent treatments of\ndiseases, including cancer, known as chronotherapy. Recent data from our group and others indicates that\ntumors exhibit temporal gene expression, with variability in rhythmic patterns among individual tumors.\nMapping tumor-specific circadian rhythms is crucial to advancing chronotherapy towards clinical application,\ndespite logistical challenges in human organ sampling.\nAligned with the PI's current project and the objectives of this RFA, we propose to analyze Common Fund\nprogram datasets to develop a robust framework for targeting chronotherapeutic processes against cancer.\nPancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDA) will serve as our focus due to the high clinical demand for novel\ntherapeutic strategies given its poor prognosis. Aim 1 involves profiling the cancer-specific molecular\nrhythmicity of human pancreatic tissue, including tumor and tumor-infiltrating immune cells, utilizing resources\nsuch as Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx), Gene Expression Omnibus, The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA),\nand COSMIC databases. In Aim 2, we aim to identify potential druggable targets for chronotherapy in PDA,\nleveraging datasets from the Knockout Mouse Phenotyping Program (KOMP2), Library of Integrated Network-\nbased Cellular Signatures (LINCS), Illuminating the Druggable Genome (IDG), and Drug Bank.\nWe will integrate data, methods, and resources from the parent project as appropriate.

We will start with an annotation-free approach using\nk-mers to preprocess IBD and diabetes cohorts. We then will apply a novel scaling technology\nimplemented in the sourmash software to reduce the data set size by a factor of 2000, rendering\nit tractable to machine learning approaches. We next will use random forests to determine a\nsubset of predictive k-mers, and will measure their accuracy on validation data sets not used in\nthe initial training. Finally, we will annotate the predictive k-mers using all available genome\ndatabases as well as a novel method to infer the metagenomic presence of accessory genomes\nof known genomes. Our outcomes will include a catalog of microbial genomes that correlate\nwith IBD subtype and the onset of diabetes, as well as automated workflows to apply similar\napproaches to other data sets.",

The Aim of\nthis proposal is to Enable FAIR5 access to datasets from these three Common Fund programs via an immersive VR\ninterface with embedded 2D/3D visualizations. Using existing, Linked Open Data (LOD) infrastructure built for the\nHuman Reference Atlas (HRA)6–9, we will Federate cell summaries from datasets and extraction sites across three\nCommon Fund programs in the HRA6–9 (Sub-Aim 1), i.e., we will identify datasets that have been registered into HRA\n3D Reference Objects (organs) via dedicated tools8, thus giving them a 3D extraction site; then, we will retrieve existing\ncell summaries for these extraction sites and registered datasets given existing cell-by-gene matrices or proteomics\nmarkers (462 datasets as of June 14, 2024). For the related Sub-Aim 2, we will Deploy CFDE datasets in the HRA\nOrgan Gallery in VR, an existing research prototype for a VR application that allows the immersive exploration of this\nmultiscale, multimodal data. Building on our prior research on Data Visualization Literacy, VR, and immersive\nanalytics10–12, we will add 2D and 3D visualization capabilities to the HRA Organ Gallery to visualize cell summaries at\nthe dataset, 3D extraction site, and anatomical structure (atlas) level. All cell summaries will be connected to 3D\nregistration sites inside one of 65 existing 3D reference organs (spatial), annotated with anatomical structure(s) that are\naligned to the UBERON13 ontology (biological structure), and associated with clinical (donor) metadata, such as age, sex,\nrace, etc. All work and code will be documented and made available to the community. Additionally, we will update\nexisting and create new training and instructions materials, not only in written form, but also as videos and inside the\nHRA Organ Gallery in VR application. Further, we are planning extensive demonstrations of this work at CFDE meetings\nand at various events organized for HuBMAP, SenNet, and GTEx researchers.",

      "abstract_text": "PROJECT SUMMARY\nThis proposal builds upon the Common Fund data resources, GTEx and HuBMAP by\nintegrating the single cell/single nucleus ATAC-seq data (sc/snATAC-seq) across these\nresources, and deploying recently developed deep learning methods to establish a cell\ntype-specific atlas of TF-element predictions.\n Across our tissues and cell types, in health and disease, our genomes selectively\nactivate and reorganize genes and cis-regulatory elements (CREs) to define diverse cell types.\nTo accomplish this, hundreds of transcription factors (TFs) organize to determine the activity of\nmillions of CREs, which in turn regulate the expression of ~25,000 genes. The vast majority of\nGWAS variants associated with common diseases and traits lie in CREs, thus a compelling\nhypothesis is that these variants disrupt binding of regulatory proteins. A grand challenge in\nbiology is therefore to identify the precise genomic locations of these regulatory proteins across\nall CREs in all cell types in an effort to understand the function of non-coding genetic variation.\n The GTEx and HuBMAP Common Fund projects have generated a critical mass of\nsn/scATAC-seq datasets (~177 to date), across many different human donors and tissues.\nThese data comprise an incredibly valuable resource of single cell data across human biology.\nWe recently developed PRINT, a deep learning model that uses ATAC-seq to more-accurately\nreveal multiscale footprints of regulatory proteins on DNA (Hu et al. bioRxiv). ATAC-seq\nprovides a measure of open chromatin. PRINT therefore enables the prediction of binding of\nregulatory proteins, such as TFs, within regions of open chromatin.\n We will reprocess and harmonize the ~177 GTEx and HuBMAP sn/scATAC datasets,\nand supplement these data with 375 ENCODE sn/scATAC datasets from human cell types and\ntissues. We will deploy PRINT to predict TF footprints in the GTEx, HuBMAP and ENCODE\nsingle cell ATAC data. We will utilize existing innovative deep learning models to annotate these\nfootprints. Taken together, these analyses will enable us to characterize TF binding in human\ntissues and cell types, and resolve changes in CRE activity and TF binding across different cell\ntypes and differentiation trajectories in vivo. All data, code, and model predictions will be made\navailable via the CFDE portal. We expect that these annotations will underpin CFDE user efforts\nto develop hypotheses regarding - and ultimately annotate - the function of genetic variants.",

This project\nwill deploy existing deep learning computational methods to predict which proteins bind to these\nregulatory switches to turn them on and off in specific cell types and tissues. We will analyze\ndata from the GTEx, HuBMAP and ENCODE projects, in order to determine how these switches\nare regulated across human tissues and cell types.",

The overall ecosystem design includes plans for cross-project data\nharvesting and analysis on a collaborative cloud computing platform. While a long-range plan may culminate\nin highly structured analytic workbenches, we propose to use approaches established in the Bioconductor\nproject to design community-driven modular approaches to data structure and interactive analysis of selected\nCommon Fund assets. Our first aim is to produce standard, easy to use interfaces to resources provided in\nthe 4D Nucleome, Illuminating the Druggable Genome, and Genotype-Tissue Expression projects. These\nCommon Fund projects provide data of considerable interest by the general research community, but data\ndiscovery and use is hampered by intrinsic complexity as well as differing access and delivery methods\nadopted by the various Common Fund projects. We will interface well-established data containers and query\nmethods to allow familiar R/Bioconductor programming idioms to work smoothly with resources from the\nselected Common Fund projects. The two-decade history of Bioconductor's approach to modular software\ndesign, documentation, integration, and distribution will sharply increase the likelihood of durable improvement\nin access to and utilization of Common Fund Assets. Our second aim is to leverage the new interfaces and\ncontainers to carry out four analytical projects in the investigation of origins of treatment persistent tumor cells\nin organoid cultures, with the objective of identifying compounds that can attenuate and provide insights into\nepigenetic mechanisms of treatment persistence. The operational and substantive outcomes of this project will\nform the basis of a comprehensive, highly community-driven approach to building strong bridges between\nconsortia innovating at the cutting edge of biotechnology, and scientists innovating in integrative translational\ninference based on genome biology.",

      "abstract_text": "ABSTRACT\nThe Cloud Workspace of the Common Fund Data Ecosystem (CFDE) will make it easy for a\nwide range of researchers to analyze data and work together. Our primary goal is to create a\nuser-friendly environment where researchers can import their data, analyze their data alongside\nother Common Fund datasets, and use a variety of analysis tools and workflows. Our Cloud\nWorkspace Implementation Center (CWIC) leverages the existing partnerships between the\nTexas Advanced Computing Center’s (TACC) unparalleled public high-performance resources,\nGalaxy’s open-source online interface for analyzing data and authoring workflows, and\nCloudBank’s tools that simplify cloud resource access and billing. By leveraging our existing\nresources and skills, this CWIC can streamline implementation of the Cloud Workspace.\nThis Cloud Workspace will provide users with access to Common Fund datasets, allow users to\nimport data from other sources, and allow for data integration and analysis. Users will have\naccess to a wide range of tools, workflows, and pipelines developed by the CFDE, by Galaxy,\nand by other partners. In addition, users will have the flexibility to use custom or third-party\ntools within the workspace. The CWIC will cater to the needs of both novice and expert users by\noffering outreach, training, and support designed to meet the diverse needs of its users. This\neffort will include user manuals, online tutorials, and tools to help users manage computing\ncosts across public and commercial computing resources. Current scientific discoveries can be\nexpensive, relying on large datasets and intensive computational processing power. Notably,\nthis Cloud Workspace will enable science across a broad set of researchers, providing access\nto large amounts of storage and compute at no cost to new users and trainees.\nBy promoting data sharing, collaboration, and ease of access, the CWIC will speed up\nbiomedical research and address high-priority challenges for our nation. The CFDE Cloud\nWorkspace represents a significant step towards realizing the vision of broadening the\ncommunity of scientists with the power to tackle complex research questions and drive\ninnovation.",

Identifying predisposition genes of\norofacial cleft holds promise for early diagnosis, preventive measures, and targeted therapies.\nHowever, pinpointing genes harboring rare causal variants remains a challenge due to limited\nstatistical power associated with typical sample sizes of hundreds or thousands of cases and\ncontrols. We propose utilizing genetic burden analyses with large control sample size and gene\nexpression data sets to discover orofacial predisposition genes. This approach leverages\nmultiple genomics datasets: ~1,400 orofacial cleft samples from Gabriella Miller Kids First\nPediatric Research Program and ~730,000 samples included in the public biobank-level\nsummary counts from the recently released Genome Aggregation Database V4, ~240 orofacial\ncleft samples and ~220K controls from All of Us Genomics data sets. Furthermore,\ntranscriptomics data sets will be analyzed to enrich potential causal genes, including the\nanalysis of both bulk and single cell RNA-seq data sets from craniofacial tissues and reference\nGTEx tissues. We will perform discovery analysis, followed by further validation and combined\nanalysis.

      "abstract_text": "Summary/Abstract\nAdvances in immunotherapy have lately revolutionized cancer care. A key strategy of cancer immunotherapy is\nto target “non-cell-autonomous” mechanisms of immune surveillance adaptation, achieved via regulating the\nsecretions of immune modulators from cancer cells. Yet, an in silico systematic screen for these targets and\nimmunomodulating agents (potentially therapeutic drugs) remains untested due to a lack of computational tools\nto analyze relevant large-scale database resources. The study is proposed in response to RFA-RM-23-003 to\nmeaningfully integrate multiple NIH Common Fund and other NIH-funded datasets to inform the molecular basis\nof immune surveillance adaptation and screen for potential immunomodulating agents. Our central hypothesis\nis that cancer genomic features captured by deep learning predict cancer cells’ non-cell autonomous signals\ninduced by a compound treatment to modulate immune cells in the tumor microenvironment. We propose to test\nthe hypothesis by developing an innovative and feasible computational framework that is built upon our published\ndeep learning models. Specifically, in Aim 1.1 we propose to identify prognosis-related immune cell types and\nassociated immunologic gene signatures among adult (The Cancer Genome Atlas [TCGA]) and pediatric tumors\n(Gabriella Miller Kids First [Kids First] and Therapeutically Applicable Research To Generate Effective\nTreatments [TARGET]). We will then build a deep learning model to predict the perturbation of the identified\nimmunologic gene signatures induced by a compound in a cancer cell line using the Library of Integrated\nNetwork-based Cellular Signatures (LINCS) data. In Aim 1.2, we will experimentally validate key findings using\nour in-house in vitro models. We have formed a cross-disciplinary team with strong complementary expertise to\nefficiently achieve the proposed goals: dry lab of Dr. Yu-Chiao Chiu (MPI) for cancer bioinformatics, multi-modal\ndata integration, and artificial intelligence; and wet lab of Dr. Yi-Nan Gong (MPI) for cancer immunology,\nimmunotherapy, and tumor cell death mechanisms. Successful completion of the pilot study will produce high-\nimpact preliminary results: i) the first deep learning framework that systematically incorporates multi-modal\ngenomic and pharmacogenomic data to screen for immunomodulating agents, ii) a deeper understanding of the\nmolecular basis of immune surveillance adaptation than was previously possible, and more importantly iii) a set\nof promising targets preliminarily validated in vitro. These preliminary data will lead to a follow-up study to explore\nfunctional and preclinical aspects of our results. We also expect the proposed study to provide a computational\nframework that enhances the utilization and integration of NIH Common Fund data and other publicly available\nlarge datasets.",

      "abstract_text": "Abstract:\nUnraveling the molecular mechanisms that link SNPs and genes identified in GWAS studies to\nthe disease is a challenge that must be overcome to translate these genetic discoveries into\nactionable health insights. We would like to build a machine learning tool on the basis of visible\nneural networks (vNN) that recently showed success to provide predictive and explanatory\npower on cellular responses to gene regulations or disease treatment. Key to the vNN approach\nis an understandable network such as Knowledge Graph that contains rich annotations of\nrelevant entities and relationships among entities organized by integrative data sources. Our\nhypothesis is that organizing and integrating data from the Common Fund Data Ecosystem\n(CFDE) can enhance the explanatory power of vNN to illuminate GWAS results. We propose\ncombining the ROBOKOP Knowledge Graph with diverse biological data from the CFDE, and\nvNN as a knowledge-based architecture to provide high interpretability in supervised learning.\nROBOKOP Knowledge Graph will serve as an organizational hub for integrating CFDE data\nwith existing knowledge. This query-able resource for CFDE data will be our first deliverable.\nWe will extract network-based relationships from this data and train vNN using genotypes and\nphenotypes from T2D-focused GWAS, providing our second deliverable. The trained vNN, our\nthird deliverable, will enable the prediction of T2D phenotypes from genotype data. Lastly, we'll\nprovide the code base as a platform to expand this KG and vNN approach to other GWAS\nstudies and potentially be generalized for genome wide ‘omic analyses with large data sets.",

However, specialized skills and training are needed to effectively access, integrate, and\ninterpret them. This project will address a shortage of these skills, by providing training and exposing students\nto examples of successful reuse of large-scale data. To equip researchers with the necessary technical, scientific,\nand implementation-related skills, we propose the Short Course on Methods for MultiOmics Data Analysis at the\nJackson Laboratory (JAX). This week-long course will focus on developing conceptual knowledge and practical\nanalytical techniques centered around rigorous analysis of Common Fund datasets. Our course will also focus\non building the soft skills needed to work effectively in collaborative research teams. Experts from Common Fund\nprojects including SenNet, KOMP2, GTEx, and the Metabolomics Workbench will serve as instructors and\nmentors in the course. Our goal is to build an educational program that cultivates rigorous, reproducible practices\nin managing and analyzing large-scale molecular data from the Common Fund while fostering effective,\nproductive research teams and long-term collaborations. Achieving these goals will strengthen scientific rigor\nand broaden the impact of Common Fund data sets.",

      "abstract_text": "Abstract\nThe increasing adoption of whole-genome sequencing (WGS) in the context of genomic medicine and\nprecision oncology has resulted in the accelerated discovery of structural variants (SVs) in patient\ncancer genomes. However, while human cancer types are generally characterized by widespread\ngenomic instability the functional consequences of most structural and copy number variants (CNV)\nremain poorly understood. Critically, it is unknown which of the hundreds to thousands of\ngenomic rearrangements typically observed in a patient tumor are pathogenic and which are non-\nfunctional genomic scars. Because SVs alter the genome at the structural (linear sequence),\ntopological (three-dimensional organization), and phenotypic levels (epigenetic landscape),\nintegrative and multiscale datasets are necessary to correctly predict their impact. This dearth of\nintegrative resources and tools critically limits the medical interpretation of patient genetic data.\nExisting large-scale genomic and proteogenomic cancer characterization efforts, including the\nCommon Fund (CF) Gabriella Miller Kids First (GMKF) data resource provide rich data to link\ngenetic information including SVs with their phenotypic consequences, such as gene expression.\nHowever, these datasets alone are insufficient to provide deep mechanistic and functional insights.\nCF data sets, specifically 4D Nucleome (4DN), Epigenomics (Roadmap), and GTEx provide the\nblueprint to link germline variation, genome topology, and chromatin architecture to gene expression.\nTherefore, we propose the integration of genomic data from patient tumor samples (GMKF), with\nspatial and functional data (4DN, Roadmap, GTEx), which will allow us to elucidate and predict the\npathogenic mechanisms of structural variants:\nAim 1: To create TopVar a data resource to enhance our understanding of the interplay between\ngenome TOPology and structural VARiation. The integrative TopVar resource will provide the\nphenotypic context required to interpret SVs in genetic and biological terms, which will yield testable\nhypotheses regarding their downstream effects.\nAim 2: To develop and evaluate a predictive model of SV pathogenicity across multiple human cancers.\nUsing the structured TopVar data resource, we will implement an interpretable statistical model to\npredict which SVs have an impact on gene expression, utilizing multiple layers of the integrated data.\nThe realization of both aims will represent a proof-of-principle for the utility of TopVar for predictive\nmodeling of SVs in the context of precision oncology. While our proposed study will focus\non interrogating the comprehensive genomic data generated by GMKF (pediatric cancer) and\nCPTAC (adult cancer), it will serve as the foundation for their use within real-time sequencing\nprograms, such as MI-OncoSeq and Peds-MI-OncoSeq, focusing on refractory and metastatic tumors.",

      "abstract_text": "Project Summary\nPediatric brain tumors are the most frequent cause of morbidity in children with solid tumors. Importantly, the\naggressive therapeutic regiments often lead to debilitating neurological effects. The realization that\ndevelopmental processes critical to brain development are also deregulated in cancer has provided new hope\nfor understanding and treating brain tumors. Indeed, single cell-RNAseq analyses have further demonstrated\nthe role of defects in lineage determination for pediatric brain tumors. To discover novel drivers of tumorigenesis,\nwe will focus on the function of three-dimensional (3D) genome folding in pediatric brain tumors. Indeed, 3D\nchromatin interactions are involved in gene expression regulation, and changes in genome folding are linked to\ncell identity acquisition during development. While there is increasing interest in elucidating the function of 3D\ngenome architecture during developmental processes and in cancer, how the 3D genome is organized in\ndifferent pediatric brain tumors and its roles in tumor formation and progression are unknown. We hypothesize\nthat disrupted 3D genome folding during embryonic or postnatal development alters gene expression leading to\nabnormal cell differentiation and tumorigenesis in the developing brain. To test our hypothesis, we will\ncomprehensively interrogate the genomes of pediatric brain tumors for non-coding variants that may affect 3D\ngenome folding. We will use a deep-learning model called Akita that predicts 3D chromatin interaction\nfrequencies from genome sequence alone. Because Akita only requires DNA sequence as input, we can predict\nthe effect of any variant within a single framework that accommodates single-nucleotide variants (SNVs),\ninsertion/deletions (indels), and structural variation (SVs). Akita will be used with pediatric brain whole genome\nsequences (WGS) from Gabriella Miller Kids First (KF) plus chromatin capture, epigenetic, and expression data\nfrom the 4D Nucleome (4DN) and Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx) programs in the following aims: 1)\nDetermine the 3D genome architecture of Atypical teratoid/rhabdoid tumor AT/RT tumors. We have initiated our\nstudy using AT/RT, tumors thought to be due to defects in early development11 and the most common brain\ntumor in children less than six months of age. 1.A. We will develop a bioinformatics pipeline that uses Akita to\nquantify how much a genetic variant is predicted to disrupt 3D chromatin interactions in AT/RT tumors. 1.B. We\nwill validate and determine the functional relevance of 3D genomic folding disruptions observed in AT/RT tumors.\n2) Determine the 3D genome architecture of malignant pediatric tumors. We will extend our analyses with Akita\nto additional malignant pediatric brain tumors, focusing for this pilot project on the most malignant and treatment\nrefractory tumors. This innovative project, using a new deep-learning tool Akita, will lead to, novel research\nhypotheses and will accelerate the discovery of additional regulators of pediatric cancer tumorigenesis and thus\nto potential therapeutic strategies for these devastating diseases.",

The FAIR\ndata principles state that research data should be “findable, accessible, interoperable, and\nreusable.” Public metabolomics data repositories and large-scale studies supported by the NIH\nCommon Fund, including Metabolomics Workbench and the Integrated Human Microbiome\nProject (iHMP), and other public mass spectrometry data repositories, such as the Global Natural\nProducts Social Molecular Networking (GNPS) and MetaboLights, have made progress in recent\nyears to address the first two FAIR principles by making metabolomics data easily findable and\naccessible. Unfortunately, the final two FAIR principles, which state that data should be\ninteroperable and reusable, have not been adequately addressed yet by the metabolomics\ncommunity. This prevents metabolomics data from multiple relevant studies to be compared and\nco-analyzed. This proposal aims to bridge this interoperability and reusability gap by harmonizing\ncommunity standards and creating accompanying computational tools for data re-analysis.\nSpecifically, this proposal will 1. Standardize and convert mass spectrometry data formats (Aim\n1), 2. Harmonize experimental metadata and analysis results with common controlled vocabulary\nwith consistent semantics across all experiments (Aim 1), 3. Develop web infrastructure to find\nand explore datasets by metadata (Aim 1), and 4. Develop cloud-enabled portable, reusable, and\nscalable co-analysis bioinformatics pipelines (Aim 2). Successful completion of these aims will\ndemocratize the ability for the entire metabolomics community to corroborate published findings,\ndiscover new metabolites that are highlighted only when co-analyzing datasets, and test\ntranslational hypotheses across different model organisms.",

We will use single cell/nucleus RNA-\nsequencing (scRNA-seq) data from the Common Fund-supported Human BioMolecular Atlas Program (HuBMAP)\nand Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx) consortia to prototype a cell type harmonization protocol for\nconstructing a cross-consortia cell census meta-atlas. The HuBMAP consortium provides organ-specific cell\natlases for multiple organs, while GTEx provides an integrated cross-organ single cell atlas. Our group has\ndeveloped and extensively validated computational algorithms, NS-Forest and FR-Match, for biomarker\nidentification and robust cell type matching using scRNA-seq data. Our algorithms utilize Random Forest\nmachine learning and minimum spanning tree graphical modeling, which provide superior classification\nperformance while maintaining high explainability and interpretability for biological applications. In Specific Aim\n1, rigorous data quality control approaches will be applied for dataset selection and preparation. The NS-Forest\nalgorithm will then be used to identify optimal biomarker combinations for characterization of organ-specific cell\ntypes of individual organs in HuBMAP and cross-organ cell types in GTEx. In Specific Aim 2, we will focus on\nhuman lung, as an exemplar organ, to prototype the assembly of a cross-consortia meta-atlas by developing a\nrobust cell type harmonization approach using our validated and benchmarked FR-Match algorithm and\nHuBMAP-Lung, GTEx lung subset, and other publicly available Human Lung Cell Atlas (HLCA) datasets. We\nwill compare and benchmark FR-Match with two other popular methods, Azimuth and CellTypist, for cell type\nmatching and validate the matching results using all methods. We will also form a domain expert panel to review\nand validate the cell type harmonization results using domain knowledge and literature information for community\napproval. We will build a strategy for capturing sample metadata, anatomic structure information, cell type\nnomenclature and biomarker-based definitions into an ontological representation for the meta-atlas and populate\nthe contents into the Provisional Cell Ontology. In Specific Aim 3, we will disseminate our results to key\nstakeholder communities, including the HuBMAP Anatomical Structures, Cell Types and Biomarkers (ASCT+B)\nWorking Group and the GTEx Multi-Gene Single Cell Query platform. We will present the project and participate\nin the Common Fund Data Ecosystem Spring Meeting for engaging the community and soliciting feedback.\nBeyond the pilot phase, the cell type harmonization framework established in this project can be generally\napplicable to integrate single cell-based cell type datasets across Common Fund and other data resources.",

Despite glycans’ significant structural heterogeneity, these glycan motifs, or determinants,\nhave been recognized as relevant in specific biological contexts and named by glycobiologists. In a\nsimilar way as protein domains, these recurring structural motifs confer specific binding and functional\nactivity to glycan structures that contain them. Many collections and catalogs of these glycan motifs have\nbeen developed but they are primarily lists – little to no functional understanding is captured by these\nresources to provide biological context for understanding a motifs’ role in the cell. The GlycoMotif data-\nresource, developed in the Edwards lab in support of the GlyGen Glycan Knowledgebase, a Common-\nFund sponsored data-resource, is one such catalog of glycan motifs, with the capability to annotate each\nmotif with names, keywords, and publications. Despite the relative paucity of our understanding of glycan\nstructure motifs’ functions, however, we do understand the glycosylation enzyme machinery responsible\nfor assembling and attaching glycans to glycoproteins, and can enumerate, though the data-resources\nprovided by GlyGen, the glycoenzymes necessary for attaching and assembling mature glycan structures\non mouse and human proteins. We seek to explore the utility of functional annotation of GlycoMotif glycan\nmotifs by the integration of gene-based phenotype, tissue-localization, and cell-type annotations of\nassociated glycoenzymes from the International Mouse Phenotyping Consortium and GTEx Common-\nFund data-resources with GlycoMotif, and thereby providing a platform for comprehensive functional\nannotation of glycan motifs, and ultimately, glycan structures in GlyGen.",

      "abstract_text": "Abstract\nExercise is associated numerous health benefits, but defining the molecular mediators of these effects remains\nan active focus of biomedical research. With the advent of the ‘omics sciences, studies including the ongoing\nMolecular Transducers of Physical Activity Consortium (MoTrPAC) and multiple smaller-scale efforts have\nsought to map the “complete” molecular response to acute and chronic exercise. Much research is currently\nfocused on integration of genomics, proteomics and metabolomics data within such studies, but another\nimportant strategy is meta-analysis of distinct data sets to evaluate consistencies and differences in molecular\nresponses observed between different modes of exercise, sex, age, species, and other factors. Of the exercise-\nrelated meta-studies performed to date, most have focused on the genome and transcriptome whereas few have\nincluded metabolomics data. Reasons for this shortcoming include differences in analytical methods,\ninconsistency in compound naming and data reporting, and prevalence of unknown features in untargeted\nmetabolomics data. Unknown metabolite identification and cross-study integration is challenging and requires\napplication of computational and experimental strategies in a coordinated manner. Yet, the potential benefits are\nsubstantial – identification of novel metabolites and detection of consistent patterns of response have led to\nbiological insights relevant to fundamental biology and human health, including exercise.\nUsing data from NIH Common Fund data archives, we propose to develop a multi-study, multi-organism and\nmulti-condition database of identified and unknown exercise responsive features of the metabolome. We will\nintegrate data across studies and, when available, across ‘omes, to prioritize and identify unknowns within this\ndatabase. We will achieve these goals by carrying out two specific aims: 1) We will perform a comprehensive\nsurvey and alignment of exercise-related small molecule features in MotrPAC data and from studies in the\nMetabolomics Workbench. We will use computational tools we have pioneered for metabolomics data cleaning,\ninter-laboratory data alignment, and network- and correlation-based analysis to prioritize unknown features for\nfollow-up. 2) We will systematically track, annotate and identify high-priority exercise-responsive unknown\nfeatures in metabolomics data using software and experimental techniques we and others have devised for\nMS/MS data collection to identify and annotate features not tractable by routine library search. Our study\nrepresents a crucial step between the map-building aims of MoTrPAC and detailed mechanistic studies of\nspecific pathways and that hold potential for human health benefits through targeted interventions. We will share\nour database and associated data with the research community through publications and uploads to public data\narchives. We anticipate our efforts will contribute to improved understanding of the effects of exercise at the\nbiochemical pathway level and will offer targets for future studies to help delineate the mechanisms by which\nsmall molecules contribute to its salutary effects on health.",

      "abstract_text": "Project Summary\nProf. Oliver Fiehn will work with his key persons, statistician Dr. Christopher Brydges, bioinformatics specialist\nDr. Yuanyue Li and programmer Gert Wohlgemuth (all UC Davis) to generate new pipelines that integrate stool\nmicrobial metagenomics data and stool mass spectrometry data to better associate metabolites with disease\nprogression in inflammatory bowel disease.\nWe will work in consultation with Dr. Clary Clish (Broad Institute) who generated and deposited the data to the\nNIH Common Funds MetabolomicsWorkbench and the iHMP integrated human microbiome data. We will\nprioritize the enormous set of more than 80,000 yet unidentified stool metabolic signals using longitudinal disease\nprogression over 1 year in subjects with inflammatory bowel disease, in comparison to healthy subjects. For this\nlimited set of not more than 1,000 metabolites that will show significant association with health outcomes, we will\nuse all available accurate mass MS/MS data and all stool microbiome data to obtain metabolite class information\nand likely metabolite structures or substructures. Dr. Clish will review our results and share new annotations that\nhis group will release.\nTo this end, we will develop the tools for metabolome predictions that have been built by the KBase collaborative\nresearch consortium over the past 10 years. KBase uses microbial genomic sequences (or even transcriptomics\ndata) to automatically build metabolic pathways through enzyme predictions and gap filling. KBase also\nempowers utilization of microbial communities, modeling import and export of metabolites that other microbes\ncan use as carbon sources. In consultation with Dr. Chris Henry (Argonne National Lab) from the KBase\nconsortium, we will then build pipelines within the KBase environment to include mass spectrometry tools that\nthe Fiehn laboratory has built through its past NIH funding, specifically formula predictions and substructure\npredictions (in MS-FINDER), retention time predictions (in Retip.app), hybrid-shift MS/MS similarity matching (in\nNIST search), and entropy similarity MS/MS matching (in MassBank.us).\nThis specific project will have large impact on other, similar microbiome/metabolome projects that will be\nuploaded to the NIH Common Funds databases in the future. The project addresses the huge complexity in stool\nmetagenomics and stool metabolomics data, and delivers key pipelines (called ‘narratives’ in KBase) that can\nbe used by the research community at large.",

      "abstract_text": "Abstract\nMaking NIH Common Fund (CF) datasets FAIR is but the first step in realizing their potential\nwithin the “big data” revolution. Science progresses through the accumulation of knowledge,\nwhich achieves a wide reach only if it is accessible to a diverse spectrum of researchers. While\ncomputer scientists have made substantial strides in modeling knowledge within “knowledge\ngraphs” (KGs), non-computational scientists can find it hard to interpret the graph-based\nreasoning tools and visualizations that accompany KGs because such tools use logical\nreasoning that does not account for scientific context or uncertainty and can produce a plethora\nof scientifically invalid inferences.\nOur CFDE KC will aim to present scientifically valid knowledge produced by CF projects. We will\nrepresent this knowledge as a KG, compliant with existing CFDE and external knowledge\ncuration efforts. But we will focus on scientific validity through both (a) careful knowledge\nextraction, by ensuring that each edge in the KG is either a primary experimental finding or the\nresult of an expert-applied analysis, and (b) careful knowledge presentation, by building a portal\nthat de-emphasizes general-purpose graph traversal in favor of single-purpose visualizations.\nTo implement this KC, we will draw from our experience managing four large-scale NIH-funded\nprojects that have faced similar challenges in related settings. First, our work on Terra provides\na foundation for securely storing biomedical data and making it available through cloud-based\nworkspaces. Second, our work on the Common Metabolic Diseases Knowledge Portal provides\na means to distill data into knowledge through expert-designed analyses that produce “summary\nrepresentations”, which are then presented through simple visualizations or multi-step\nprescriptive workflows. Third, our work on the A2FKP provides experience tailoring knowledge\nextraction and presentation to a variety of communities with different cultures and preferences.\nFinally, our work on the Biomedical Translator provides experience developing and complying\nwith standards for knowledge representation and exchange.\nIn specific aim 1, we will coordinate working groups of CFDE and external investigators to\nreview the knowledge across CF projects and propose how to extract and represent it within the\nKC. In specific aim 2, we will work with CF DCCs to define summary representations of their\ndata, provide them with software to make these summary representations available to us, and\nregularly “pull” and integrate these summaries within a KG compliant with Translator standards.\nIn specific aim 3, we will use the software UI/UX and search infrastructure developed for the\nCMDKP and A2FKP to build a knowledge portal that enables a diverse spectrum of scientists to\nvisualize and search CF data. In specific aim 4, we will combine our and the CF DCC’s prior\neducation and outreach strategies to publicize the portal and educate people in its use. Finally,\nin specific aim 5, we will interface with other CFDE centers to build a combined Resource Portal\nand form partnerships with external resources to amplify the reach of our KC.\nTogether, these aims will produce a CFDE KC that will unlock the full potential of CF resources\nthrough an emphasis on scientific validity, enabling scientists of all levels of expertise to\nunderstand, trust, and build upon them.",

      "abstract_text": "Abstract\nMaking NIH Common Fund (CF) datasets FAIR is but the first step in realizing their potential\nwithin the “big data” revolution. Science progresses through the accumulation of knowledge,\nwhich achieves a wide reach only if it is accessible to a diverse spectrum of researchers. While\ncomputer scientists have made substantial strides in modeling knowledge within “knowledge\ngraphs” (KGs), non-computational scientists can find it hard to interpret the graph-based\nreasoning tools and visualizations that accompany KGs because such tools use logical\nreasoning that does not account for scientific context or uncertainty and can produce a plethora\nof scientifically invalid inferences.\nOur CFDE KC will aim to present scientifically valid knowledge produced by CF projects. We will\nrepresent this knowledge as a KG, compliant with existing CFDE and external knowledge\ncuration efforts. But we will focus on scientific validity through both (a) careful knowledge\nextraction, by ensuring that each edge in the KG is either a primary experimental finding or the\nresult of an expert-applied analysis, and (b) careful knowledge presentation, by building a portal\nthat de-emphasizes general-purpose graph traversal in favor of single-purpose visualizations.\nTo implement this KC, we will draw from our experience managing four large-scale NIH-funded\nprojects that have faced similar challenges in related settings. First, our work on Terra provides\na foundation for securely storing biomedical data and making it available through cloud-based\nworkspaces. Second, our work on the Common Metabolic Diseases Knowledge Portal provides\na means to distill data into knowledge through expert-designed analyses that produce “summary\nrepresentations”, which are then presented through simple visualizations or multi-step\nprescriptive workflows. Third, our work on the A2FKP provides experience tailoring knowledge\nextraction and presentation to a variety of communities with different cultures and preferences.\nFinally, our work on the Biomedical Translator provides experience developing and complying\nwith standards for knowledge representation and exchange.\nIn specific aim 1, we will coordinate working groups of CFDE and external investigators to\nreview the knowledge across CF projects and propose how to extract and represent it within the\nKC. In specific aim 2, we will work with CF DCCs to define summary representations of their\ndata, provide them with software to make these summary representations available to us, and\nregularly “pull” and integrate these summaries within a KG compliant with Translator standards.\nIn specific aim 3, we will use the software UI/UX and search infrastructure developed for the\nCMDKP and A2FKP to build a knowledge portal that enables a diverse spectrum of scientists to\nvisualize and search CF data. In specific aim 4, we will combine our and the CF DCC’s prior\neducation and outreach strategies to publicize the portal and educate people in its use. Finally,\nin specific aim 5, we will interface with other CFDE centers to build a combined Resource Portal\nand form partnerships with external resources to amplify the reach of our KC.\nTogether, these aims will produce a CFDE KC that will unlock the full potential of CF resources\nthrough an emphasis on scientific validity, enabling scientists of all levels of expertise to\nunderstand, trust, and build upon them.",

      "abstract_text": "Project Summary\nAs we age, our tissues and organs experience molecular and physiological damage that prevents them from\nfunctioning properly and this ultimately leads to disease states. These changes are not only due to the aging\nprocess itself but are largely influenced by the exposome which includes all non-genetic exposures\n(environmental and behavioral). Depending on the complex interaction between the exposome of an individual\nand their genetics, different organs deteriorate over time at a different pace, resulting in tissues with different\nbiological ages within the same individual. As the biological age of a given organ reflects its overall health and\nfunctional capacity, biologically older organs are more likely to cause health problems increasing the risk of\ndiseases. Aging “clocks” powered by omics technologies (transcriptomics, proteomics, epigenomics, etc.) and\nmachine learning methods have been used to approximate the biological age of specific tissues. However,\ntissue-specific clocks require omics data from a biopsy, making clinical adoption impractical. Therefore, there is\na critical need to develop simple diagnostic tools using readily accessible biological material to measure organ-\nspecific aging rates in an individual which can be translated into personalized actionabilities and enable accurate\nevaluation of the efficacy of health-promoting interventions. Using blood, the pipeline of the immune system,\nfrom aging cohorts we and others have demonstrated that accelerated aging, as evidenced by age-related\nchronic inflammation (inflammaging) and dysfunctional immune systems, results in organ dysfunction and an\nelevated risk of disease in older subjects. This is not surprising since inflammaging has been proposed to be a\ncommon denominator of most, if not all, diseases of aging. In this proposal, we hypothesize that the biological\ninformation to investigate the aging rates of a given organ is contained in the blood of the same individual and\nthus, can be estimated using a collection of tissue-specific gene expression signatures matched with those from\nblood samples. Here, we will assemble multiple public domain datasets within and outside of the NIH Common\nFund to create blood-based organ-specific clocks and enable rapid diagnostics of aging rates for a given organ\nin an individual. To do so, we will use transcriptomic data across multiple tissues and matched blood from the\nGenotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx) database to construct a computational framework that calculates the rate\nof aging of 45 tissues in an individual using blood gene expression. We will validate the resulting models to\npredict organ-specific aging in disease states specific to the organ of interest, and we will assess the influence\nof lifestyle factors including diet, exercise and smoking on the aging of different organs using data from the\nFramingham Heart Study. Finally, we will use the Library of Integrated Network-based Cellular Signatures\n(LINCS) to identify candidate compounds that can restore the gene expression changes in the blood associated\nwith tissue aging to optimal levels.",

      "phr_text": "PROJECT NARRATIVE\nThe proposed research is of significant clinical relevance as it enables the early detection of accumulated tissue\ndamage at the subject level, thereby providing opportunities for developing personalized preventative\ninterventions. Additionally, by predicting tissue aging at the level of individual organs through the analysis of\nblood samples, the proposed study has the potential to avoid unnecessary diagnostic tests and ‘one-size-fits-all’\ntreatment approach or other interventional procedures, resulting in huge cost savings for healthcare systems\nand ultimately benefiting public health. Furthermore, this study also provides new insights into how lifestyle and\nenvironmental cues can differentially impact aging across tissues and proposes a series of candidate compounds\nthat may prevent age-driven tissue damage and diseases.",

      "abstract_text": "Abstract\nHuman cancers are highly heterogeneous. Studying tumor and tumor-microenvironment (TME), particularly\nthose that are likely to develop resistance, is essential for the effective development of personalized anti-cancer\ntherapy. In recent years the development of new single-cell genomics technologies, such as single-cell RNA-\nSeq (scRNA-Seq), has made this analysis possible at the single-cell level. Drug repurposing is an effective\nstrategy for identifying and developing new uses of drugs outside the scope of their original medical application.\nThis strategy offers various advantages over developing an entirely new drug for cancer therapeutics, such as\nthe lower risk of failure, significantly shorter time frame for drug development, and much less cost. The “reverse\nmatching” approach to search for drugs from large pharmacogenomics databases such as the LINCS L1000\nsystem has been shown as an effective approach to apply to the genomics data. However, conventional\ncomputational methods using the reverse matching principle have been relying on bulk samples, overlooking the\ncomplexity of the tumor ecosystem. To fill in the gap, we have recently developed a comprehensive drug\nrepositioning computational framework called ASGARD (version 1.0), which utilizes the single cell RNA-Seq\n(scRNA-Seq) transcriptomics data as the input. In this project, we will improve ASGARD version 1.0 to the next\nversion, by fully exploiting the features related to tumorigenesis. We will consider genetic information, in addition\nto gene expression from scRNA-Seq data; we will also include interactions between tumor cells and TME cells\nto formulate the new and improved drug scores, for drug ranking. After benchmarking, we will apply ASGARD\nversion 2.0 to repurpose drugs for primary liver cancers. We will validate these drug candidates using a\ncombination of literature evidence, in vitro experiments and electronic medical record (EMR) data.",

      "abstract_text": "Project Summary\nThe rich, diverse, and complementary multimodal datasets provided by the Common Fund Data Ecosystem's\n(CFDE) Data Coordinating Centers (DCCs) provide exciting opportunities for integrative analysis and\nexploration. Here, we propose a systematic data visualization-driven approach to investigate the model-based\npredictions of the target genes of candidate cis regulatory elements (cCREs). Our project will leverage\nbiomolecular data from key repositories in the CFDE, including the Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx)\nproject, the Human BioMolecular Atlas Program (HuBMAP), the Cellular Senescence Network (SenNet), and\nthe 4D Nucleome (4DN) consortium, and will expand to include genomic data from external large projects\nsuch as the Encyclopedia of DNA Elements (ENCODE) project. Our motivating use case is the integrative\nexploration and validation of predictions for target genes of cCREs in the context of relevant linkage\ndisequilibrium (LD), molecular quantitative trait loci (QTLs), epigenomic, transcriptomic, (spatial and\nnon-spatial) single-cell, and Chromosome Conformation Capture (3C/Hi-C) data. Central to this objective are\n(1) a ﬂexible data management system tailormade for visualization that addresses the challenges of organizing\nprivate and federated public datasets, (2) tools for the creation of custom, interactive exploratory\nvisualizations, and (3) the ability to save and share visualizations in a FAIR manner. To achieve our goals, we\nwill develop the Common Fund Visualization Hub, a cloud-based platform enabling uniﬁed access to data\nresources in the CFDE alongside user-contributed, private data in projects. It will provide a ﬂuid metadata\ntagging system that supports structured and unstructured tags. It will support multiscale, genomic\nvisualization using HiGlass along with a user interface for on-the-ﬂy visualization construction based on the\nGosling visualization grammar. It will also support multimodal data visualization using Vitessce and enhance\nreusability through sharing of visualizations and storytelling features to communicate discovery processes.\nThe Common Fund Visualization Hub will thus facilitate comprehensive data interpretation and\ncommunication through integrative, interactive analysis of diverse genomic and bioimaging datasets. Using\nthis platform, we will evaluate and compare regulatory element-to-gene predictions from leading machine\nlearning models based on diﬀerent evidence-based methodologies. By streamlining integrative visualization of\nexisting CFDE data, our platform aims to help maximize the utility of CFDE investments to accelerate\nbiomedical discovery. Our platform will empower community members to independently browse, record, and\npresent their own data combined with data sourced from across the ecosystem, enhancing collaboration and\ncommunication both within and across research groups, as well as with the broader community and the\ngeneral public.",

      "abstract_text": "Abstract\nTo help ensure that Common Fund Data Ecosystem (CFDE) data assets, data tools, and resources are\nfindable, accessible, interoperable, and reusable (FAIR), the project will create a CFDE Training Center\n(TC) responsive to the needs of biomedical researchers and current and future CFDE data programs. The\nTC will serve as the central hub for training development, coordination, and evaluation across CFDE\nprograms and data initiatives.\nGoals of the TC are to expand the Common Fund (CF) data userbase, enhance the confidence and\ncomplexity of dataset usage, and increase awareness of the CFDE and resources. Team ORAU proposes to\naccomplish with (1) training intentionally designed to address gaps in the training landscape, (2) outreach\nactivities and a mentoring program designed to support the growing community of CF users, and (3) the\nestablishment of a collaborative and supportive learning community. The TC will provide a dynamic\nsyllabus tailored to meeting the needs of a diverse community of scientists and medical researchers at all\nexperience levels, with focus on postgraduate students and early-stage investigators. The TC will design\nand deliver customized trainings and training tools to address both broad data skills needs and the\ncustomized needs of specific CFDE data initiatives and Data Coordinating Centers. Matching students and\nearly career scientists with experienced bioinformaticians and CF data users, the CFDE Mentoring Program\nwill provide technical and professional guidance to engage learners and encourage careers in bioinformatics\nand data sciences. The TC recruitment and outreach functions will focus on engaging a diverse and equitable\nset of trainers and participants. The learning community will be supported by internal processes and\nfunctions put in place to facilitate communication and collaboration, including a CFDE Trainers Working\nGroup to share best practices and leverage shared resources, a Diversity Committee to ensure diversity,\nequity, inclusion and accessibility (DEIA) is embedded in all activities and processes, a CFDE Landing\nPage on the CFDE Portal providing a public gateway to CFDE training resources, and a CFDE Virtual\nCommunity of Learners providing learning support and guidance to all training participants as well as a\nplatform for communication and engagement.\nDevelopment of the TC will require in-depth landscape analysis to assess, identify, and address the training\nopportunities and needs of the CFDE community. The landscape analysis will include comprehensive gap\nanalysis, examining current tools and processes and training content, systematic literature review, key\ninformant interviews, CF research community survey, and other data gathering from National Institutes of\nHealth (NIH) stakeholders and biomedical community at large. Ongoing evaluation and assessment of\ntraining activities will inform program enhancements and outcomes, achievements, and challenges will be\nreported out to the common fund and other CFDE coordinating centers.\nThe TC will be developed and managed by a qualified and experienced team of training professionals and\ndata scientists from Oak Ridge Associate Universities (ORAU) and BioData Sage LLC, working in close\ncoordination with the CF and the CFDE stakeholder community. Project management processes and\ncontrols will ensure that the TC and affiliated training programs and engagement activities are appropriate,\neffective, and efficient. Program development and management will take an integrated flexible approach,\ncoordinating closely with NIH and integrating feedback and activities from across the CFDE to ensure\nalignment in all areas.",

      "abstract_text": "ABSTRACT\nAI tools such as deep learning models promise significant improvements in healthcare efficiency, accuracy, and\nfairness. However, without careful development, these systems might unintentionally exacerbate healthcare\ndisparities. Subtle variations in medical imaging, influenced by factors like a patient's race, gender, or insurance\nstatus, may be imperceptible to humans but can be leveraged by AI algorithms, potentially leading to biased\npredictions.\nThis project seeks to uncover hidden signals in AI models and evaluate their potential effects on fairness. We\nwill utilize three extensive medical imaging datasets from Emory University, encompassing a variety of patient\npopulations and outcomes. Using advanced generative techniques, we will generate synthetic counterparts of\nthese datasets based on demographics, social factors, and clinical variables. Deep learning models will then be\ntrained on both real and synthetic images to predict sociodemographic factors and measure the persistence of\nhidden signals across data types. By exposing models to manipulated synthetic data, we aim to identify potential\nunfair associations undetectable in actual patient data. Additionally, we will condense images into mathematical\nrepresentations and conduct predictive experiments to ascertain if shortcuts are present. Radiologists will\nanalyze simulated videos transitioning images between demographic groups to visualize results and determine\nif these shortcuts hold clinical relevance. Our objective is to develop tools and guidelines fostering the creation\nof reliable AI systems in medical imaging to enhance patient outcomes across all groups.\nOverall, this project combines innovative data generation, predictive modeling, and human-AI collaborative\nevaluation to proactively identify and mitigate unfair bias in healthcare AI. Our findings will help prevent AI from\nperpetuating disparities and ensure it fulfills its potential to provide equitable quality care for diverse populations.",

Many computational techniques have been developed to identify ligand-receptor pairs that mediate\nthese CCIs using either bulk and single cell datasets, as well as spatial transcriptomic datasets. However, the\nanalysis of transcriptomics data produces thousands of ligand-receptor interactions that difficult to prioritize for\nexperimental validation. Thus, there is a need for a computational tool that will rank CCIs for experimental\nvalidation. Here we propose to create a database of putative CCIs across several epithelial barrier tissues,\nincluding skin, intestine, and reproductive tissue. We will then employ a ranking system that uses information\nfrom several Common Fund datasets to rank cell-cell interactions for experimental validation. Finally, we will\nvalidate our approach using existing spatial transcriptomic datasets. Overall, the results of this work will\nleverage the wealth of existing data to better contextualize CCIs, allowing the scientific community to prioritize\nnovel CCIs for experimental validation.",

There is no known cure and the average life expectancy of an ALS patient is 3-5 years from\nthe time of diagnosis. Therefore, it is important to identify the genetic alterations that are involved in the molecular\npathogenesis of ALS in order to develop targets for therapeutics. Genome-wide occurrence of DNA repeat\nexpansions has been identified as a common genetic cause or marker of several neurodegenerative diseases,\nincluding ALS. Here we propose to survey the whole genome sequencing data from a population of ALS patients\nand healthy individuals for recurrent repeat expansions, correlate these findings with gene expressions, and\nfinally study mechanisms of regulation of identified genes by integration of gene expression, chromatin\naccessibility, and 3D genome organization data. We hypothesize that many of the overlooked repeat expansions\nare located in the non-coding regions of the genome and are involved in regulation of genes that might contribute\nto the death of motor neurons. To this end, we will first identify the recurrent repeat expansions that act as tissue-\nspecific expression quantitative trait loci using GTEx data. We will then integrate multi-omics data from ALS\npatients with 3D genome data from the 4DN project to identify gene regulatory circuitry. We envision that the\nproposed work will allow scientists to generate experimentally testable hypotheses by creating a link between\nnon-coding repeat expansions and genes in a tissue-specific manner and help identify new therapeutic targets.",

A pressing challenge, however, is the lack of understanding of microbial drug metabolism.\nExperimental studies, clinical observations, and anecdotal examples demonstrate that microbial enzymes alter\ndrugs through common enzymatic transformations such as reduction, hydrolysis, dehydroxylation,\ndemethylation, and others. Despite progress, there lacks a systematic approach for the discovery and analysis\nfor such transformations, thus hindering the design and interpretation of experimental studies. There is therefore\na need to establish workflows to explore such transformations.\nWe investigate in this proposal microbial drug metabolism at the molecular and community levels. We are\nproposing to use data from two Common Fund data sets to conduct this investigation. Illuminating the Druggable\nGenome (IDG) catalogues drugs and their pharmacologic action, while the NIH Human Microbiome Project\n(HMP) provides detailed gut microbial data for cohorts. We are also proposing to use our deep-learning tools to\npredict the likelihood of interaction between microbial enzymes and drugs (Aim 1), and to predict putative\nderivative products due to this interaction (Aim 2). Our tools (CSI for Aim 1, and GNN-SOM and PROXIMAL for\nAim 2) have already been validated on other datasets and in other studies, and they will be adapted for microbial\nenzymes and drugs based on data culled from IDG and HMP and other resources. The workflows established\nin Aims 1 and 2 will be utilized to conduct a pilot study (Aim 3) to investigate the extent of functional redundancy\ntowards drugs within microbial communities of healthy individuals that are culled from HMP.\nThe strength of our Approach therefore lies in: i) adapting novel, state-of-the-art deep-learning models to predict\nmicrobial enzyme promiscuity on drugs, ii) providing biochemically explainable drug products, and iii) exploring\nhow drug microbial metabolism is a function of microbial community composition. The Significance of this\nresearch is that it provides an explainable hypothesis of microbial drug metabolism. The work is impactful as it\nwill enable further studies, such as exploring the functional redundancy of a microbial community towards drugs\n(as planned in Aim 3) and designing and interpreting experimental studies involving the impact of the gut\nmicrobiota on drugs. The proposed work is appropriate for this funding opportunity as it curates and annotates\ndata using novel deep-learning approaches and creates a previously unexplored link between the HMP and IDG.\n1",

      "abstract_text": "PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT\n Mass spectrometry in combination with chromatography provides a powerful approach to characterize\nsmall molecules produced in cells, tissues and other biological systems. In essence, measured metabolites\nprovide a functional readout of cellular state, allowing novel biological studies that advance our understanding\nof health and disease. Currently, the main bottleneck in metabolomics is determining the chemical identities\nassociated with the spectral signatures of measured masses. Despite the growth of spectral databases and\nadvances in annotation tools that recommend the chemical structure that best explains each signature, the large\nmajority of measured masses cannot be assigned a chemical identity. There is now consensus that gleaning\npartial information regarding the measured spectra in terms of chemical substructure or chemical classification\ncan inform biological studies. This consensus is reflected in the newly updated reporting standards for metabolite\nannotation as proposed by the Metabolite Identification Task Group of the Metabolomics Society. As we show\nin our Preliminary Results, spectral characterization results in “features” that can enhance performance in\nmachine-learning tasks such as annotation.\n This work aims to enhance the use and value of the metabolomics dataset in Metabolomics Workbench\nby: (1) developing machine-learning tools trained on this dataset to characterize unknown spectra, and (2) adding\ncharacterization information to the Metabolomics Workbench dataset. In Aim 1, we identify spectral patterns\n(motifs) that can represent chemically meaningful groupings of peaks within the spectra (e.g., peaks associated\nwith aromatic substructures, loss of a substructure fragment, etc.). We utilize neural topic models that use\nvariational inference to identify such motifs. We expect such models to offer computational speedups and to\nidentify more chemically coherent motifs when compared to earlier implementations of topic modeling. We\ngenerate motifs across all spectra in the Metabolomics Workbench and provide annotations for each spectrum.\n In Aim 2, we map spectral signatures to chemical ontology classes. As ontologies are hierarchical and\nas a molecule can be associated with multiple classes at different hierarchical levels of an ontology, we cast this\nmapping problem as a hierarchical multi-label classification problem and use neural networks to implement such\na classifier. The classifier will be trained using the Metabolomics Workbench dataset. Learned motifs from Aim\n1 will be used as additional input features to improve classification. We expect that the developed classifier can\nbe used by others to elucidate measurements of unidentified molecules with chemical ontology classes, or to\ngenerate ontology terms that can be used as features in downstream machine-learning tasks.",

      "abstract_text": "Project Summary\nSingle-cell transcriptomics have revolutionized biomedical research over the last decade and are now widely\nused in both industry and academia. Today there are >100 million cells profiled and available in the public\ndomain, and many of these datasets were generated through Common Fund projects such as HuBMAP, GTEx,\nBRAIN, and SCORCH. These and other projects aim to serve as reference datasets that can be re-used for\ncomparisons with other datasets, and such resources are often referred to as cell atlases. Therefore, the ability\nto integrate cell atlases with each other and with external datasets is crucial to ensure their utility. However,\ncombining datasets can be challenging due to the presence of batch effects—experimental artifacts resulting\nfrom variability in sample processing. If not accounted for, batch effects can be mistaken for biological signals.\nIn recent years, several computational methods to identify and correct batch effects have been developed.\nNonetheless, challenges remain, particularly in scaling up to millions of cells from thousands of batches.\nAdditionally, users need to download large volumes of data, which can be costly and time-consuming.\nOne of the most popular methods for batch correction is Harmony, which we published in 2019. Harmony is\ntransparent, intuitive, fast, and accurate, as demonstrated by independent benchmarks. Briefly, Harmony first\nuses principal component analysis to project cells into a latent space. It then iteratively performs k-means\nclustering and ridge regression to identify robust clusters that are not confounded by artifacts. Here, we propose\ntwo aims to add new functionality to Harmony to eliminate some of the remaining bottlenecks.\nIn many use cases, a researcher will want to integrate their own data with a subset of an atlas, such as datasets\ncontaining the same tissue type. To speed up this process, we will leverage our pre-calculated global integration\nto allow for fast comparisons. This will be achieved by building a tree structure where nodes represent cell types\nat various levels of granularity. New cells are then projected into the same latent space, and by traversing the\ntree, we can quickly identify which existing cell types they most closely resemble. With cell atlases containing\nmillions of cells, downloading and storing the data can become an issue. One way to overcome this challenge is\nto perform computations where the data resides, rather than transferring the data first. As previously mentioned,\nHarmony relies on three classic algorithms (PCA, k-means, and sparse regression), all of which can be executed\nin a distributed manner. In this context, we assume different parts of the data will reside on distinct servers, and\nDistributed Harmony will require only summary statistics to be transferred between servers.\nWe envision that the proposed methods can be deployed in collaboration with organizations maintaining cell\natlases. Additionally, the distributed algorithms and infrastructure we develop will be valuable for many other\napplications in computational genomics, e.g. population genetics and microbiome research.",

Although there is an enormous potential for the\nlarge datasets available through the CDFE to advance biomedical research, our broad needs assessment has\nidentified that a wide range of researchers lack fundamental skills necessary to use these types of data. Gaps\nwe have identified include identifying the appropriate data sets to answer hypotheses, managing, wrangling,\nand harmonizing data in preparation for analysis, in addition to performing the analyses. We propose to close\nthis gap and accomplish our objects by: 1) Performing a needs assessment of potential Common Fund Data\nusers, targeting early career clinically oriented faculty developing research related to the human microbiome.\n2) Developing curricular materials for knowledge and skills in data science using three datasets developed by\nNIH Common Fund projects related to the human microbiome, microbial products, and clinical associations. 3)\nDelivering a two-week in-person short course on data science to a diverse set of early career learners to\neducate and provide skills necessary for accessing data in the Common Fund Data Ecosystem and\nincorporating these data sources into research. And 4) Providing extended support beyond the short-course\nthrough informatics mentorship to support common fund data use in participant’s area of research. The\nprogram will be led by experts in Biomedical Informatics Education and Microbiome Bioinformatics and be\nsupported by several faculty with expertise and extensive educational experience in data science, clinical\ninformatics, artificial intelligence and machine learning, data visualization, and data management. The short\ncourse will focus on applications of CFDE to address research questions related to the human microbiome in\nhuman health and disease, with a specific focus on diabetes. We anticipate the impact of this program to be\nsubstantial in enabling researchers to improve their use of existing CFDE projects into their own research more\nrapidly and accurately. We will disseminate this work broadly through online resources so that others may train\ntheir own teams.",

      "abstract_text": "Project Summary/Abstract\nGene duplication is a major mechanism for the evolution of novel gene functions. Copy-number and sequence\nvariation within multigene families are associated with many phenotypes, human diseases, and evolutionary\nadaptations. Yet systematic incorporation of gene paralog variation into studies of genomic diversity is lacking.\nMost existing tools are not well suited to delineating differences among gene family members or require\nprohibitively large computational resources. We recently developed an approach, QuicK-mer2, which efficiently\nestimates gene copy-number in a paralog specific manner. Application of our approach to data from the 1000\nGenomes Project revealed rare gene-paralog variants that have not been previously reported. Here, we propose\napplication of QuicK-mer2 to create paralog specific copy-number estimates from existing NIH Common Fund\ngenomics data sets. In specific Aim 1, we will analyze genome sequencing data from the Genotype-Tissue\nExpression (GTEx) consortium to define the effect of gene paralog variation on gene expression levels. Although\nwe will assess the entire genome, we will focus our analyses on variation among the largest family of transcription\nfactors, KRAB-ZFPs (Kruppel-related AB box zinc finger proteins), to identify trans-acting expression QTL. In\nspecific Aim 2, we will analyze variation among duplicated genes in the Gabriella Miller Kids First Data Resource\nwith a focus on structural birth defects, a phenotype to which copy-number variation is known to be a key\ncontributor. Many recurrent copy-number variants arise in regions which are flanked by large segments of\nduplicated sequence with a high identity. Many of these regions of segmental duplication also contain members\nof duplicated gene families that have important biological functions. Here, we will focus on discovering previously\nmissed gene copy number variation within the duplicated sequences themselves. Together, completion of these\naims will give a fuller picture of the extent of genomic variation and the impact of differences among gene\nparalogs on gene regulation and disease.",

      "abstract_text": "PROJECT SUMMARY\nExercise represents one of the most powerful and beneficial interventions for health and wellness, though patients with and without chronic disease struggle to exercise enough to garner its benefits. One sought after approach to overcoming these challenges is to provide the benefits of exercise pharmacologically, a so-called \"exercise-in-a-pill\" solution. This involves identifying biomolecular mechanisms responsible for exercise benefits and engaging them pharmacologically using small molecule agents. To accelerate discovery of exercise mimetic drugs, this project synergizes existing data from two National Institutes of Health Common Fund projects. The Molecular Transducers of Physical Activity Consortium (MoTrPAC) provides a map of the biomolecular response to exercise, while the Library of Integrated Network-Based Cellular Signatures (LINGS) Program provides a map of the biomolecular response to small molecule exposure. The investigators hypothesize that biomolecular exercise pathways and small molecule drug candidates from these two resources can be matched by their shared biomolecular \"signatures\". The maps are linked by matching exercise-induced changes in biomolecular expression (i.e., a gene expression \"signature\" of exercise) from MoTrPAC to similar expression changes induced by small molecules found in LINGS. By linking these two data sets, the project will create a detailed, browsable, and interactive resource for identifying potential exercise mimetics. Aim 1 seeks to identify biomolecular signatures of exercise training from MoTrPAC by analyzing publicly released multi-omic response data from MoTrPAC's exercise training studies in young adult rats. Specific objectives include: 1) identifying biomolecular \"signatures\" through gene set enrichment analysis, network clustering, and gene regulatory networks; 2) evaluating the validity and reliability of these signatures across tissues, sexes, and timepoints in the rat study; and 3) generating an annotated database of signatures for alignment with LINGS. Aim 2 integrates MoTrPAC and LINGS biomolecular signatures in a cloud-based infrastructure that matches MoTrPAC signatures with those available from LINGS. This infrastructure will be designed to 1) organize, browse, and fiter the MoTrPAC signatures database; 2) query existing cloud-based applications developed by LINGS for engagement with their library of data; and 3) deliver these results in a visually informative and interactive web application to maximize the user's ability to gain novel insights. Future efforts will expand the infrastructure by adding new MoTrPAC data and annotating exercise signatures with knowledge from other Common Fund datasets. Additionally, the project aims to leverage results to identify and prioritize pathways related to insulin resistance and other diseases for experimentation in model systems. This comprehensive approach seeks to accelerate the identification of exercise mimetics and provide valuable resources to translational researchers and stakeholders in the pharmaceutical pipeline.",

Some 60%\nof patients fail to receive a molecular diagnosis; for patients with isolated CHD, the failure rate is closer to 90%.\nWithout a precise diagnosis, it is difficult to provide any patient with an accurate prognosis or personalized\ninterventions. The main reason that diagnostic testing fails is that our knowledge of the genetic underpinnings of\nCHD remains woefully incomplete. CHD is not only genetically heterogeneous, but also notorious for incomplete\npenetrance (variants that do not always cause a condition). In this proposal we aim to quantify the role of\nincomplete penetrance in CHD risk genes. We will source a large cohort of CHD families fromthe Gabriella Miller\nKids First resource, the Undiagnosed Disease Network, Genomics England, and an internal research study and\nperformtwo complementary analyses to rank CHD genes. First, we will apply a genetic association study of CHD\nprobands to prioritize genes with an increased burden of rare genetic variation among CHD patients irrespective\nof the inheritance pattern. This will be achieved through an innovative new resource: a remote control database\nof 40,000 healthy, diverse controls and a method to securely select matched controls for any given case cohort.\nSecond, we will performpedigreeanalysis of all CHD families to identify genes in which rare large-effect variants\nsegregate with disease. Finally, we will combine the results of both strategies into a single master table of CHD\ngenes and use the segregation patterns observed in all families to quantify the extent of incomplete penetrance.\nWe expect our results will serve as a reference for the diagnostic initiatives in CHD and will inform clinical\ngeneticists about the likelihood of disease causality for genes challenged by incomplete penetrance. Our results\nshould provide a framework for integrating association and segregation analyses that could be adapted to other\ngenetically heterogeneous conditions.",

Within the\nIDG, the Knowledge Management Center (IDG-KMC) integrates data from a wide range of chemical, biological\nand clinical resources, and has developed platforms that can be used to navigate understudied proteins (the\n“dark genome”), and their potential contribution to specific pathologies. Specifically, the IDG KMC is creating\nautomated workflows to capture relevant public data for the entire proteome including manual annotations for\nthe IDG list, covering five major areas: genotype, phenotype, expression, structure & function, and interactions\n& pathways. The IDG KMC designs, develops, implements, and updates the Target Central Repository Database\n(TCRD), a protein knowledgebase. The IDG KMC also expands, improves, and maintains Pharos, the TCRD\nportal, with support for automated data summaries, and active community feedback. Both TCRD and Pharos\nalready integrate data from three Common Fund projects: GTEx, IMPC/KOMP and LINCS. The IDG KMC\nconsolidates all the data generated by the Data and Resource Generation Centers (DRGCs), improving these\ndata findability, accessibility, interoperability, reusability (FAIRness) and serving these data on the Pharos portal.\nThe IDG program interface with the CFDE will enable hypothesis generation about novel drug targets for complex\ndiseases. Many other Common Fund (CF) programs produce data about genetic variants and differentially\nexpressed genes and proteins in the context of many complex human diseases. These genes in many cases do\nnot have much information about them. For example, the CF program Undiagnosed Disease Network (UDN)\nidentifies mutations in genes associated with undiagnosed diseases. The IDG-KMC has information from\nempirical evidence and from computational predictions about the function of these genes, which are commonly\nunder-studied. Hence, data from the IDG-KMC can enrich the CFDE users who examine datasets that list genes\nand proteins. Several IDG resources provide gene landing pages that provide unique information about genes.\nThese landing pages can be improved regarding FAIRness and can become a resource for the CFDE. In\naddition, data collected by the DRGCs and by the R03 IDG awardees can enrich the content of the CFDE portal. In\nparticular, results from the R03 projects (Fig. 1) are currently not evaluated or stored in one place and are at risk\nof becoming lost.

The IDG KMC\nconsolidates all the data generated by the Data and Resource Generation Centers (DRGCs), improving these\ndata findability, accessibility, interoperability, reusability (FAIRness) and serving these data on the Pharos portal.\nThe IDG program interface with the CFDE will enable hypothesis generation about novel drug targets for complex\ndiseases. Many other Common Fund (CF) programs produce data about genetic variants and differentially\nexpressed genes and proteins in the context of many complex human diseases. These genes in many cases do\nnot have much information about them. For example, the CF program Undiagnosed Disease Network (UDN)\nidentifies mutations in genes associated with undiagnosed diseases. The IDG-KMC has information from\nempirical evidence and from computational predictions about the function of these genes, which are commonly\nunder-studied. Hence, data from the IDG-KMC can enrich the CFDE users who examine datasets that list genes\nand proteins. Several IDG resources provide gene landing pages that provide unique information about genes.\nThese landing pages can be improved regarding FAIRness and can become a resource for the CFDE. In\naddition, data collected by the DRGCs and by the R03 IDG awardees can enrich the content of the CFDE portal. In\nparticular, results from the R03 projects (Fig. 1) are currently not evaluated or stored in one place and are at risk\nof becoming lost. The CFDE engagement will ensure that data from this investment remains available long term.",

      "abstract_text": "For the 30 million Americans living with a rare disease, 95 percent of those diseases do not currently have an\nidentified therapeutic option. Advances in genetics and omics technologies coupled with increased availability\nof health data present an opportunity to make precise personalized patient care broadly a clinical reality.\nHowever, the lack of rare disease clinical samples and suitable preclinical models for research and\ndevelopment often makes it difficult to even nominate, let alone test, therapeutic options for these patients. To\naid rare disease research, our long term goal is to develop and apply approaches leveraging multi-omics data\nto nominate and prioritize drug targets and repurposing candidates. In this project, our main objective is to\nconduct a feasibility study based on analyses across NIH Common Fund and other publicly available data,\ndeveloping research methods to support data integration. In Aim 1, we will pursue bioinformatics analysis to\nidentify and improve optimal preclinical rare disease models by piloting approaches for identifying the best cell\nline as an avatar for a given patient (Aim 1a) and for analyzing patient induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)\nprofiles in the context of the most clinically relevant tissue types (Aim 1b). In Aim 2, we will determine and test\nprioritized drug repurposing candidates for rare diseases by implementing transfer learning to project data on\nto cell line-by-perturbation data and identifying drug candidates that might rescue cell physiology deficits (Aim\n2a). We will test top drug repurposing candidates for each phenotype in either patient-derived iPSC cell lines or\nxenograft mouse models and generate and analyze RNA-seq profiles pre- and post-treatment for future use in\nrefining computational models (Aim 2b). We focus here on two rare diseases which both desperately need\nimproved therapeutic options: Friedreich’s ataxia (FRDA) and rare brain tumors including glioblastoma\nmultiforme (GBM). We will use NIH Common Fund data sets specified in this Funding Opportunity\nAnnouncement (GTEx, Kids First, LINCS, and PHAROS), other NIH-supported data sets (TCGA and\nCCLE/DepMap), and RNA-seq data generated in our lab at UAB. Because we are advancing this methodology\nin two disease systems simultaneously, we will demonstrate broad utility of these approaches and ensure a\nhigh chance of success in the one year timeframe. These approaches will be the basis of a conceptual\nframework for subsequent R01-level funding regarding genome-guided precision medicine approaches and\ncomputational methods development, as well as generating hypothesis for future collaborative GBM and FRDA\nresearch projects. The interdisciplinary approaches described here are crucial for advancing bench-to-bedside\nrare disease studies both at UAB, a leader in rare disease diagnosis, as well as in the broader scientific\ncommunity. Upon successful completion of this proposal, we expect our contribution to be advancements to\nboth preclinical modeling of, and prioritizing drug repurposing candidates for rare diseases as well as\ndemonstrate how Common Fund data can be used to accelerate rare disease research.",

Although proteomics offers unique insight into various pathophysiological\nprocesses, currently many proteomics datasets remain smaller in scale than their RNA-seq counterparts and\nit remains to be investigated how best to integrate proteomics and RNA-seq data to maximize their utility.\nThe goal of this pilot project is to assess the feasibility of integrating multi-omics data to generate new\nhypotheses about cross-tissue physiology. We will perform three integrated tasks during the funding period:\n First, we will integrate data across tissues, species, and omics data type in two NIH Common Fund\nprojects, namely GTEx v8 and MoTrPAC Release v1.0, with the aid of transfer learning methods. Our goal is\nto learn a low-dimension representation of gene expression structure across human tissues that can be\napplied to other datasets to facilitate integrative analysis.\n Second, we will apply an RNA-sequencing guided proteomics pipeline and software that we recently\ndeveloped in order to extract hidden peptide information from Common Fund proteomics data, including\nisoform and post-translational modifications. We will then evaluate the feasibility and utility of integrating\ntranscriptomics and proteomics data to examine multi-tissue correlations in gene expression.\n Lastly, we will utilize this data analysis pipeline in order to predict cross-tissue communication pat-\nterns from transcriptomics and proteomics data, then perform limited experimental validation of the\ncomputational findings using human induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-derived cells. If successful, we\nenvision that the results will inform on data integration strategies that can help further increase the utility of\nlarge-scale proteomics and RNA-seq data in the public domain, as well as generate testable hypotheses on\ngene co-expression across multiple tissues that can inform future work.",

Tissue-specific genes show narrow expression, play\nkey roles in maintaining tissue homeostasis and are thought to be good drug candidates. Thus, targeting of\ndysfunctional tissue-specific genes can provide a safer therapeutic approach due to the reduced risk of side\neffects. However, identifying which tissue-specific genes are critical in disease is a bottleneck in drug discovery.\nWe hypothesize that key tissue-specific genes have the ability to spread perturbations in a protein-protein\ninteractome and can be identified by their context specific functionality. This approach offers a paradigm shift\nfrom conventional analyses that uniquely focus on one-gene expression levels. We recently proposed Gene\nUtility Model (GUM) which hypothesizes that it is how a gene is utilized in protein-protein interaction (PPI)\nnetwork dictates its importance in disease development. We will use information flow of a gene within a PPI\nnetwork to represent the gene utility in a given biological state. Under this scenario, genes with high information\nflows (i.e., high gene utilities) in a disease state, instead of gene expression level, are deemed to play more\nimportant roles in disease development. Thus, this application seeks to increase the clinical utility of NIH\nCommon Funds datasets by employing state-of-the-art systems biology approaches to precisely and reliably\nidentifying tissue-specific druggable functional genes (TS-DFGs). We will construct a prototype for Common\nFund Gene Utility Compendium by leveraging four NIH Common Fund datasets: Genotype Tissue Expression\n(GTEx), Library of Integrated Network-based Cellular Signatures (LINCS), Illuminating the Druggable Genome\n(IDG), and 4D Nucleome (4DN). We will focus on three disease types, liver cancer, nonalcoholic fatty liver\ndisease (NAFLD), and Alzheimer's disease (AD) as proof-of-concept studies. In Aim 1, we will uncover highly\nutilized tissue-specific genes across multiple normal tissue types and three selected disease types. We will then\nconstruct utility karyotype to indicate chromosomal regions enriched with highly utilized genes. In Aim 2, we will\nemploy selectivity, controllability, and suitability as criteria to score druggability for TS-DFG candidates with\nrespect to liver cancer, NAFLD, and AD. Druggable utility networks (DUNs) with respect to each disease type\nwill be constructed to assess the distribution of highly score TS-DFGs in a PPI network and signaling pathways.\nThe constructed prototype of the Common Fund Gene Utility Compendium will promote innovative research to\nenhance the usage and provide added clinical value for the NIH Common Fund datasets by offering a new\nparadigm shift for target and drug discovery. Our long-term goal is to enlarge this compendium by including\nmore diseases across different tissue types to facilitate integrative pan-tissue analyses and drive drug\ndiscovery.",

      "abstract_text": "PROJECT SUMMARY\nIdentifying biomarkers that are diagnostic, robust and generalizable across individuals while possessing\ntherapeutic values is the most wanted endeavor in medicine. However, there are numerous challenges in the\nidentification of such robust therapy-associated biomarkers (TABs). For example, most of the current methods\nseek to achieve statistically significant differential biological signals in general patient cohorts but fail to\nacknowledge heterogenous genetic backgrounds and phenotypic diversity among individual patients. Our recent\nstudies using newly developed machine learning-based feature engineering approaches and conducted in a\npan-cancer study across 12 cancer types showed that biologically constrained features (named herein\ninvariant features) are universal in disease and can be used to classify individual cancers. Importantly, we also\nshow that invariant features can be used to build de novo biological networks and discover network hubs that\ncan be successfully utilized to infer the expression of associated genes. As such, invariant features can act as\ninformation encoders. Using information from Drug Repurposing Hub we show that these hub genes are also\ndrug targets. Collectively, these observations suggest that invariant feature hubs can be TAB candidates. We\npropose that under the new light of biological constraints, we can use a dynamic approach for biomarker\ndiscovery that encapsulates both the genetic heterogeneity and molecular fluctuation across individual patients.\nOur central hypothesis is that disease states show constrains in their molecular activities, and identifiable\ninvariable features possess diagnostic and therapeutic values. The main objective of this proposal is to uncover\nTABs using selected NIH Common Fund datasets (namely, exRNA, GTEx, LINC, and IDG). In Aim 1, we will\ntest the hypothesis that biologically constrained invariant features are universal to most if not all biological states.\nWe will show this by finding invariant features with respect to each biological state from selected Common Fund\ndatasets. We will conduct comparative analyses in disease and normal states in order to dissect disease-specific\ninvariant features. Next, in Aim 2, we will test the hypothesis that invariant feature hubs are TABs. We will show\nthis by determining the diagnostic capability of invariant feature hubs for their “encodability” to reconstruct the\nexpression values of their associated invariant feature genes in different individual patients diagnosed under\nsame disease type. Finally, we will map these invariant feature hubs to IDG and DrugBank to determine their\ndruggability. For those understudied hubs with no known drugs, we will perform computational analyses such as\nhomology modeling and machine learning to characterize their druggability. We expect timely accomplishment\nof proposed aims and successful completion of this project will no doubt provide added values for the selected\nCommon Fund datasets, while providing a new paradigm shift of biomarker and therapeutic target discovery.",

Our tools will integrate 4DN and GTEx data and overcome the limit of the 2D nature of Hi-C\nfrequency heatmaps, enabling construction of large 3D ensembles of high-resolution models of\nsingle-cell chromatin conformations for loci containing tissue-specific genetic variants associated with\ndifferential expression. By accounting for 3D polymer effects of random collision between genomic\nelements due to nuclear volume confinement, our tools will identify chromatin interactions that are\nstatistically significant and likely biologically important. With the ensemble model of single-cell 3D\nchromatin conformations, our tools will further identify participating genes, promoters, enhancers, and\nother elements, and elucidate how they are physically arranged in space around genetic variants\nassociated differential gene expression, including how units of higher order many-body interaction for\ngene regulation may form. In addition, our tools will quantify the presence of heterogeneous\nsubpopulation of cells with different chromatin 3D configurations, allowing probabilistic understanding\nof the heterogeneous physical interactions around eQTLs. With planned comparative analysis of 3D\nchromatin conformations from different tissues, different spatial pattern of arrangement of genes and\nelements important for gene expression will be uncovered, resulting better understanding of genome\nstructure and function relationship. Overall, we will demonstrate significant added-power of\nintegrating two important Common Fund data resources and will provide tools to facilitate\nunderstanding the relationship between genome topology and gene expression.

The ability of establishing\nrelationship between enhancers and their target genes is critically important, as it will aid in our\nunderstanding of gene regulation and in establishing the relationship between noncoding risk variants\nfrom GWAS studies to potential causal genes. Our approach will be based on 3D polymer models of\nchromatin interactions derived from Hi-C data in the common fund 4D Nucleome (4DN) database,\nand will integrate data from the common fund supported Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx)\ndatabaseas, as well as data from ENCODE database.

For 1),\nwe will develop a pipeline to identify a small set of critical specific chromatin 3D interactions through\nsimulation of large scale folding of 3D chromatin ensembles. The small set of specific interactions will\nbe tested for sufficiency of chromatin folding. We will then identify computationally enhancers based\non epigenetic histone modifications and chromatin accessibility data from ENCODE as well as the\nRoadmap Epigenomics Project. We will then select enhancers containing eQTLs from the GTEx\ndatabases, which are known to affect the expression of the target gene. The end result will be a high-\nquality and trustworthy database of enhance-gene pairs, which will be provided by the predicted\ncritical specific 3D physical chromatin interactions connecting the eQTL-containing enhancer and the\ntarget gene. For 2), we will develop a machine-learning predictor that predicts enhancer-gene\ninteractions from genomic, epigenomic, and Hi-C data at genome-wide scale. We will combine\nepigenetic data with genomic information (such as sequence motifs of TFs) as features. We will then\ntrain a machine learning predictor through hold-outs and cross-validations of the constructed\ndatabase of enhancer-target gene pairs from 1). The efficacy of the predictor will then be assessed\nwith the gold-standard of the CRISPRi-FlowFISH data. We will then carry out large scale\ncomputational and will construct databases of predicted enhancer-gene relationship for selected cell\ntypes.

In the past few\nyears, the genetic studies of smoking and drinking addiction have made significant progress. With the help of\nlarge datasets and advanced analytical methods, we have identified >400 associated loci in samples of European\nancestry. As a next step, we will expand our study to include samples of non-European populations, in order to\nfurther empower discovery and elucidate the genetic architecture.\nA majority of the identified GWAS loci are non-coding. A critical first step to understand their function is to\nidentify the target gene. Transcriptome-wide association study (TWAS) was proposed to link regulatory variants\nto target genes. In its original form, TWAS integrates eQTL and GWAS data from the matched ancestry. As multi-\nethnic studies become more prevalent, it has been shown that direct integration of European eQTL with non-\nEuropean GWAS would lead to loss of power and the results may be difficult to interpret as well. A majority of\nCommon Funds functional genomic data (e.g., GTEx and 4DN) were primarily from European ancestry. It\nremains unclear whether they remain useful in multi-ethnic studies and if so, how to effectively utilize them.\nHere we propose a series of methodological innovations to combine GTEx data, epigenetic and 3D genomes data\nand other non-European functional genomic data to improve the gene expression prediction accuracy across\ntissue types and ancestries. For a given gene expression model, we will also propose methods to perform provably\noptimal TWAS in multi-ethnic genetic studies. These proposed methods, if successful, will open doors to use\nCommon Funds data in the next generation genetic studies of complex traits in diverse populations. Compared\nto extremely expensive data generation, these method development projects are cost effective and could be highly\nimpactful for maximizing the utility of Common Funds datasets.",

The ENCODE project has\nannotated genome-wide regulatory elements. The Roadmap Epigenomic project has characterized tissue-speciﬁc\nvariation in epigenetic state. The NIH Common Fund GTEx project has delineated tissue-speciﬁc gene expression\nand transcription regulation. The NIH Common Fund 4D Nucleome (4DN) project has revealed dynamic 3D\nchromatin organization in many cell and tissue types. Each of the aforementioned consortia has generated\nthousands or even tens of thousands of datasets, and provided different insights regarding human genome at an\nunprecedent scale and depth. However, the datasets generated from these consortia are isolated in terms of cell\ntypes and tissue types covered, how the data are stored, and the resolution of the genomic data. These gaps\nbring realistic data analysis challenges to biomedical researchers when they use these public datasets jointly in\ntheir research — they need to go through different data portals with heterogeneous processing pipelines, different\ndata formats, and unmatched resolutions. We aim to develop the most cutting-edge deep learning approaches to\nimpute high-resolution chromatin contact maps, and integrate the high-resolution chromatin contact maps with\ntranscriptional data available from GTEx project and epigenomic data from ENCODE/Roadmap. We plan to\nshare the integrated data on a public web server with a multi-panel interactive visualization genome browser.\nThe integrated data will provide an important resource for understanding of tissue-speciﬁc genetic variation in the\nlight of the spatial organization of these genomic and epigenomic elements and their functional implications.",

      "abstract_text": "Abstract\nThe diversity of human tissues and cell types is controlled by differential regulation of gene expression. Enhancers\nare the primary units of gene expression control in humans, which physically interact with the target genes\nto activate them. To understand the mechanism of transcriptional regulation, several landmarking consortia\nhave accumulated large amounts of genomic data. The NIH Common Fund GTEx project has revealed tissue-\nspecific gene expression and transcriptional regulation. The NIH Common Fund 4D Nucleome (4DN) project\nhas characterized 3D chromatin interactions in many human tissues and cell types. The ENCODE project and\nthe Roadmap Epigenomic project have profiled tissue-specific epigenomic states and annotated the regulatory\nelements accordingly.\n However, our understanding of human transcriptional regulation remains limited. A major challenge in studying\nEnhancer-Promoter (E-P) interactions is that enhancers are often located tens to hundreds of kilobases distal to\ntheir target genes, yet must physically interact with their target genes to activate them. Therefore, to understand\ngene regulation in human, a necessary first step is to precisely map all E-P interactions. However, current 3D\nmaps of the human genome remain sparse and noisy and fail to detect the vast majority of E-P interactions. In\naddition, the datasets generated from the Common Fund consortia are isolated in terms of cell types and tissue\ntypes covered, how the data are stored, and the resolution of the genomic data, resulting in additional barriers for\nintegrative analysis.\n Here we propose to combine the experimental approach, Region Capture Micro-C, and the deep learning\nalgorithms to accurately quantify E-P interactions. These results enhance the current 3D maps from 4DN and\nENCODE projects. We also plan to integrate experimental and imputed E-P interactions with NIH Common Fund\ndata in a knowledge graph. Our knowledge graph will support efficient cross-modality queries, graph visualization,\nand customized computational modeling for investigating quantitative rules in transcriptional regulation. Not only\nwould this accomplishment have an enormous positive impact on the utility and usage of the Common Fund\ndatasets, but it would also help to promote open science and reproducible research in the areas of computational\ngenomics and data science.",

We plan to apply our recently developed Region\nCapture Micro-C to profile ultra-high-resolution contact maps for selected genomic regions from three human\ncell types, and then use our deep learning approach CAESAR to impute the ultra-deep genome-wide chromatin\ncontact maps for diverse human tissues, which will provide accurate quantification of E-P interactions. These E-P\ninteractions will be integrated with NIH Common Fund GTEx and 4DN datasets in knowledge graphs.",

In the proposal, we aim to leverage shared donors between these\nconsortia and systematically investigate these connections at allele-level in many human tissue types. With\nthe single cell datasets available from these donors, we will narrow down from tissue level to cell type level,\nand further interrogate these allele-specific cross-modality connections. In essential, our analysis seamlessly\nintegrates two NIH Common Fund datasets, namely 4DN and GTEx datasets, and ENCODE datasets. With this\nintegrated data source, biomedical researchers can easily navigate, browse, compare and investigate the high\nquality, high resolution, and comprehensive datasets regarding chromatin organization, regulatory elements,\nepigenomic status and transcriptional activity with allele-specificity and cell-type-specificity.

      "abstract_text": "Driving scientific questions that will be addressed by engaging with the CFDE and why it has not\nyet been feasible\nThe Library of Integrated Network-based Cellular Signatures (LINCS) program (1) collected massive data\nfrom human cells perturbed by thousands of single small molecules as well as knockouts, knockdowns,\nand over-expression of single genes. The diverse collections of perturbed human cells (n>50) were profiled\nbefore and after the perturbations with an array of omics assays that include transcriptomics, proteomics,\nepigenomics, cell viability, and imaging at different time points and where the small molecules were applied\nin different concentrations. Altogether, over 2 million signatures are expected to be produced and provided\nas a resource for the community for query and reuse at the time when the LINCS program officially ends\n(6/2020). Such a resource can be used for limitless applications, for example, to study molecular\nmechanisms of disease, repurpose existing drugs, predict side effects and indications for pre-clinical small\nmolecules, associate small molecules with the targets that they likely affect directly and indirectly,\nreconstruct cell signaling and gene regulatory networks, understand the global space of all possible cellular\nstates in response to all possible perturbations of all human cells, and many more applications and use\ncases. This utilization of LINCS resources is already happening but can be significantly enhanced via\ncontinued efforts led by the LINCS Data Coordination and Integration Center (DCIC) through interactions\nwith the CFDE and other CF DCCs in the next 3 years.\nSo far, the ~400 publications produced by the LINCS consortium have been cited by ~6,000 other papers,\ndemonstrating the high impact of the program on the research community. In particular, the computational\nresources developed by the LINCS DCIC have been very successful. These tools and databases were\nalready visited by >1 million unique users, with currently ~30,000 unique users per month (based on Google\nAnalytics). These strong usage statistics demonstrate the value of LINCS resources and their potential for\nmaking long-lasting impact on drug discovery, and the biomedical research community in general. The\nLINCS DCIC developed web-based resources to enable the federated access, intuitive querying, and\nintegrative analysis and visualization of the LINCS data combined with other relevant data. To achieve this\nthe LINCS DCIC also processed many additional external data types from other relevant resources to be\nintegrated with LINCS data including data from other Common Fund programs such as GTEx, Epigenomics\nRoadmap, and IMPC. However, such data integration efforts were achieved with little consideration of\ncommunity standards to ensure their long term findability, accessibility, interoperability and reusability\n(FAIR) (2). Our involvement with the NIH Data Commons Pilot Project Consortium (DCPPC) and the\nCommon Fund Data Ecosystem (CFDE) taught us many lessons on how to better achieve data\nharmonization via the adoption of community standards to achieve long term sustainability of LINCS\nresources. Hence, by interacting with the CFDE, adhering to the requirements that the CFDE will establish,\nwe will be able to reprocess the LINCS data, and the other data we use to integrate with LINCS, with\ntransformations that will enable improved FAIRness, further enabling more complex use cases.\nIn addition, by interacting directly with other CF DCCs we will enable the direct integration of LINCS data\nwith other CF generated resources. Our plan is to develop an interactive web-based data visualization\ncomponent that will enable users to project RNA-seq samples (patients, single cells, or signatures) into a\nlower dimensional space based on their transcriptomics data profiling. Such visualization will be linked to\nthe metadata describing each sample, as well as automatically identified clusters, enrichment analysis\nresults for each sample or cluster, and predictions of drugs and small molecules from the LINCS resource.\nThis interactive web-based data visualization component will enable, for example, assisting KidsFirst portal\nusers, including physicians, to prescribe the most appropriate therapeutics to the right subtype of patients,\nas well as trace patients over time to monitor their response to treatment enable decision support for\nchanging treatment course early, if necessary.\nFinally, by moving all LINCS resources into a cloud environment through STRIDES, we will ensure that\nLINCS resources are archived for the long term ensuring maximal reuse and enabling applications that are\ncurrently not even imagined or possible.",

      "abstract_text": "Abstract\nThe NIH Common Fund (CF) programs have produced transformative datasets, databases,\nmethods, bioinformatics tools and workflows that are significantly advancing biomedical research\nin the United States and worldwide. Currently, CF programs are mostly isolated. However,\nintegrating data from across CF programs has the potential for synergistic discoveries. In addition,\nsince CF programs have a time limit of 10 years, sustainability of the widely used CF digital\nresources after the programs expire is critical. To address these challenges, the NIH established\nthe Common Fund Data Ecosystem (CFDE) program which has been recently approved to\ncontinue to its second new phase. For the second phase of the CFDE, this project will establish\nthe Data Resource Center (DRC) and the Knowledge Center (KC). Our efforts will culminate in\nproducing The CFDE Workbench which will be composed of three main products: the CFDE\ninformation portal, the CFDE data resource portal, and the CFDE knowledge portal. These three\nweb portals will be full-stack web-based applications with a backend database and will be\nintegrated into one public site.\nThe CFDE information portal will be the entry point to the other two portals. It will contain\ninformation about the CFDE in a dedicated About page, information about each participating and\nnon-participating CF program, information about each data coordination center (DCC), a link to a\ncatalog of CF datasets, and a link to a catalog of CF tools and workflows, news, events, funding\nopportunities, standards and protocols, educational programs and opportunities, social media\nfeeds, and publications.\nThe CFDE data resource portal will contain metadata, data, workflows, and tools which are the\nproducts of the CF programs, and their data coordination centers (DDCs). We will adopt the C2M2\ndata model for storing information about metadata describing DCC datasets. We will also archive\nrelatively small omics datasets that do not have a home in widely established repositories and do\nnot require PHI protection. In addition, we will expand the cataloging to CF tools, APIs, and\nworkflows. Importantly, we will develop a search engine that will index and present results from\nall these assembled digital assets. In addition, continuing the work established in the CFDE pilot\nphase, users of the data portal will be able to fetch identified datasets through links provided by\nthe DCCs via the DRS protocol. This will include links to raw and processed data.\nThe CFDE knowledge portal will provide access to CF programs processed data in various\nformats including: 1) knowledge graph assertions; 2) gene, drug, metabolite, and other set\nlibraries; 3) data matrices ready for machine learning and other AI applications; 4) signatures; and\n5) bipartite graphs. In addition, the extract, transform, and load (ETL) scripts to process the data\ninto these formats will be provided. Since such processed data is relatively small, we will archive\nand serve this processed data, mint it with unique IDs, and serve it via APIs. In addition, we will\ndevelop workflows that will demonstrate how the processed data can be harmonized. At the same\ntime, we will document APIs from all CF DCCs and provide example Jupyter Notebooks that\ndemonstrate how these datasets can be accessed, processed, and combined for integrative\nomics analysis. For the knowledge portal we will also develop a library of tools that utilize these\nprocessed datasets. These tools will have some uniform requirements enabling a plug-and-play\narchitecture.\nTo achieve these goals, we will work collaboratively with the other CFDE newly established\ncenters, the participating CFDE DCCs, the CFDE NIH team, and relevant external entities and\npotential consumers of these three software products. These interactions will be achieved via\nface-to-face meetings, virtual working groups meeting, one-on-one meetings, Slack, GitHub,\nproject management software, and e-mail exchange. Via these interactions, we will establish\nstandards, workstreams, feedback and mini projects towards accomplishing the goal of\ndeveloping a lively and productive Common Fund Data Ecosystem.",

The diverse collections of perturbed human cells (n>50) were profiled\nbefore and after the perturbations with an array of omics assays that include transcriptomics, proteomics,\nepigenomics, cell viability, and imaging at different time points and where the small molecules were applied\nin different concentrations. Altogether, over 2 million signatures are expected to be produced and provided\nas a resource for the community for query and reuse at the time when the LINCS program officially ends\n(6/2020). Such a resource can be used for limitless applications, for example, to study molecular\nmechanisms of disease, repurpose existing drugs, predict side effects and indications for pre-clinical small\nmolecules, associate small molecules with the targets that they likely affect directly and indirectly,\nreconstruct cell signaling and gene regulatory networks, understand the global space of all possible cellular\nstates in response to all possible perturbations of all human cells, and many more applications and use\ncases. This utilization of LINCS resources is already happening but can be significantly enhanced via\ncontinued efforts led by the LINCS Data Coordination and Integration Center (DCIC) through interactions\nwith the CFDE and other CF DCCs in the next 3 years.\nSo far, the ~400 publications produced by the LINCS consortium have been cited by ~6,000 other papers,\ndemonstrating the high impact of the program on the research community. In particular, the computational\nresources developed by the LINCS DCIC have been very successful. These tools and databases were\nalready visited by >1 million unique users, with currently ~30,000 unique users per month (based on Google\nAnalytics). These strong usage statistics demonstrate the value of LINCS resources and their potential for\nmaking long-lasting impact on drug discovery, and the biomedical research community in general. The\nLINCS DCIC developed web-based resources to enable the federated access, intuitive querying, and\nintegrative analysis and visualization of the LINCS data combined with other relevant data. To achieve this\nthe LINCS DCIC also processed many additional external data types from other relevant resources to be\nintegrated with LINCS data including data from other Common Fund programs such as GTEx, Epigenomics\nRoadmap, and IMPC. However, such data integration efforts were achieved with little consideration of\ncommunity standards to ensure their long term findability, accessibility, interoperability and reusability\n(FAIR) (2). Our involvement with the NIH Data Commons Pilot Project Consortium (DCPPC) and the\nCommon Fund Data Ecosystem (CFDE) taught us many lessons on how to better achieve data\nharmonization via the adoption of community standards to achieve long term sustainability of LINCS\nresources. Hence, by interacting with the CFDE, adhering to the requirements that the CFDE will establish,\nwe will be able to reprocess the LINCS data, and the other data we use to integrate with LINCS, with\ntransformations that will enable improved FAIRness, further enabling more complex use cases.\nIn addition, by interacting directly with other CF DCCs we will enable the direct integration of LINCS data\nwith other CF generated resources. Our plan is to develop an interactive web-based data visualization\ncomponent that will enable users to project RNA-seq samples (patients, single cells, or signatures) into a\nlower dimensional space based on their transcriptomics data profiling. Such visualization will be linked to\nthe metadata describing each sample, as well as automatically identified clusters, enrichment analysis\nresults for each sample or cluster, and predictions of drugs and small molecules from the LINCS resource.\nThis interactive web-based data visualization component will enable, for example, assisting KidsFirst portal\nusers, including physicians, to prescribe the most appropriate therapeutics to the right subtype of patients,\nas well as trace patients over time to monitor their response to treatment enable decision support for\nchanging treatment course early, if necessary.\nFinally, by moving all LINCS resources into a cloud environment through STRIDES, we will ensure that\nLINCS resources are archived for the long term ensuring maximal reuse and enabling applications that are\ncurrently not even imagined or possible.",

      "abstract_text": "Driving scientific questions that will be addressed by engaging with the CFDE and why it has not\nyet been feasible\nThe Library of Integrated Network-based Cellular Signatures (LINCS) program (1) collected massive data\nfrom human cells perturbed by thousands of single small molecules as well as knockouts, knockdowns,\nand over-expression of single genes. The diverse collections of perturbed human cells (n>50) were profiled\nbefore and after the perturbations with an array of omics assays that include transcriptomics, proteomics,\nepigenomics, cell viability, and imaging at different time points and where the small molecules were applied\nin different concentrations. Altogether, over 2 million signatures are expected to be produced and provided\nas a resource for the community for query and reuse at the time when the LINCS program officially ends\n(6/2020). Such a resource can be used for limitless applications, for example, to study molecular\nmechanisms of disease, repurpose existing drugs, predict side effects and indications for pre-clinical small\nmolecules, associate small molecules with the targets that they likely affect directly and indirectly,\nreconstruct cell signaling and gene regulatory networks, understand the global space of all possible cellular\nstates in response to all possible perturbations of all human cells, and many more applications and use\ncases. This utilization of LINCS resources is already happening but can be significantly enhanced via\ncontinued efforts led by the LINCS Data Coordination and Integration Center (DCIC) through interactions\nwith the CFDE and other CF DCCs in the next 3 years.\nSo far, the ~400 publications produced by the LINCS consortium have been cited by ~6,000 other papers,\ndemonstrating the high impact of the program on the research community. In particular, the computational\nresources developed by the LINCS DCIC have been very successful. These tools and databases were\nalready visited by >1 million unique users, with currently ~30,000 unique users per month (based on Google\nAnalytics). These strong usage statistics demonstrate the value of LINCS resources and their potential for\nmaking long-lasting impact on drug discovery, and the biomedical research community in general. The\nLINCS DCIC developed web-based resources to enable the federated access, intuitive querying, and\nintegrative analysis and visualization of the LINCS data combined with other relevant data. To achieve this\nthe LINCS DCIC also processed many additional external data types from other relevant resources to be\nintegrated with LINCS data including data from other Common Fund programs such as GTEx, Epigenomics\nRoadmap, and IMPC. However, such data integration efforts were achieved with little consideration of\ncommunity standards to ensure their long term findability, accessibility, interoperability and reusability\n(FAIR) (2). Our involvement with the NIH Data Commons Pilot Project Consortium (DCPPC) and the\nCommon Fund Data Ecosystem (CFDE) taught us many lessons on how to better achieve data\nharmonization via the adoption of community standards to achieve long term sustainability of LINCS\nresources. Hence, by interacting with the CFDE, adhering to the requirements that the CFDE will establish,\nwe will be able to reprocess the LINCS data, and the other data we use to integrate with LINCS, with\ntransformations that will enable improved FAIRness, further enabling more complex use cases.\nIn addition, by interacting directly with other CF DCCs we will enable the direct integration of LINCS data\nwith other CF generated resources. Our plan is to develop an interactive web-based data visualization\ncomponent that will enable users to project RNA-seq samples (patients, single cells, or signatures) into a\nlower dimensional space based on their transcriptomics data profiling. Such visualization will be linked to\nthe metadata describing each sample, as well as automatically identified clusters, enrichment analysis\nresults for each sample or cluster, and predictions of drugs and small molecules from the LINCS resource.\nThis interactive web-based data visualization component will enable, for example, assisting KidsFirst portal\nusers, including physicians, to prescribe the most appropriate therapeutics to the right subtype of patients,\nas well as trace patients over time to monitor their response to treatment enable decision support for\nchanging treatment course early, if necessary.\nFinally, by moving all LINCS resources into a cloud environment through STRIDES, we will ensure that\nLINCS resources are archived for the long term ensuring maximal reuse and enabling applications that are\ncurrently not even imagined or possible.",

      "abstract_text": "Abstract\nThe NIH Common Fund (CF) programs have produced transformative datasets, databases,\nmethods, bioinformatics tools and workflows that are significantly advancing biomedical research\nin the United States and worldwide. Currently, CF programs are mostly isolated. However,\nintegrating data from across CF programs has the potential for synergistic discoveries. In addition,\nsince CF programs have a time limit of 10 years, sustainability of the widely used CF digital\nresources after the programs expire is critical. To address these challenges, the NIH established\nthe Common Fund Data Ecosystem (CFDE) program which has been recently approved to\ncontinue to its second new phase. For the second phase of the CFDE, this project will establish\nthe Data Resource Center (DRC) and the Knowledge Center (KC). Our efforts will culminate in\nproducing The CFDE Workbench which will be composed of three main products: the CFDE\ninformation portal, the CFDE data resource portal, and the CFDE knowledge portal. These three\nweb portals will be full-stack web-based applications with a backend database and will be\nintegrated into one public site.\nThe CFDE information portal will be the entry point to the other two portals. It will contain\ninformation about the CFDE in a dedicated About page, information about each participating and\nnon-participating CF program, information about each data coordination center (DCC), a link to a\ncatalog of CF datasets, and a link to a catalog of CF tools and workflows, news, events, funding\nopportunities, standards and protocols, educational programs and opportunities, social media\nfeeds, and publications.\nThe CFDE data resource portal will contain metadata, data, workflows, and tools which are the\nproducts of the CF programs, and their data coordination centers (DDCs). We will adopt the C2M2\ndata model for storing information about metadata describing DCC datasets. We will also archive\nrelatively small omics datasets that do not have a home in widely established repositories and do\nnot require PHI protection. In addition, we will expand the cataloging to CF tools, APIs, and\nworkflows. Importantly, we will develop a search engine that will index and present results from\nall these assembled digital assets. In addition, continuing the work established in the CFDE pilot\nphase, users of the data portal will be able to fetch identified datasets through links provided by\nthe DCCs via the DRS protocol. This will include links to raw and processed data.\nThe CFDE knowledge portal will provide access to CF programs processed data in various\nformats including: 1) knowledge graph assertions; 2) gene, drug, metabolite, and other set\nlibraries; 3) data matrices ready for machine learning and other AI applications; 4) signatures; and\n5) bipartite graphs. In addition, the extract, transform, and load (ETL) scripts to process the data\ninto these formats will be provided. Since such processed data is relatively small, we will archive\nand serve this processed data, mint it with unique IDs, and serve it via APIs. In addition, we will\ndevelop workflows that will demonstrate how the processed data can be harmonized. At the same\ntime, we will document APIs from all CF DCCs and provide example Jupyter Notebooks that\ndemonstrate how these datasets can be accessed, processed, and combined for integrative\nomics analysis. For the knowledge portal we will also develop a library of tools that utilize these\nprocessed datasets. These tools will have some uniform requirements enabling a plug-and-play\narchitecture.\nTo achieve these goals, we will work collaboratively with the other CFDE newly established\ncenters, the participating CFDE DCCs, the CFDE NIH team, and relevant external entities and\npotential consumers of these three software products. These interactions will be achieved via\nface-to-face meetings, virtual working groups meeting, one-on-one meetings, Slack, GitHub,\nproject management software, and e-mail exchange. Via these interactions, we will establish\nstandards, workstreams, feedback and mini projects towards accomplishing the goal of\ndeveloping a lively and productive Common Fund Data Ecosystem.",

      "abstract_text": "Driving scientific questions that will be addressed by engaging with the CFDE and why it has not\nyet been feasible\nThe Library of Integrated Network-based Cellular Signatures (LINCS) program (1) collected massive data\nfrom human cells perturbed by thousands of single small molecules as well as knockouts, knockdowns,\nand over-expression of single genes. The diverse collections of perturbed human cells (n>50) were profiled\nbefore and after the perturbations with an array of omics assays that include transcriptomics, proteomics,\nepigenomics, cell viability, and imaging at different time points and where the small molecules were applied\nin different concentrations. Altogether, over 2 million signatures are expected to be produced and provided\nas a resource for the community for query and reuse at the time when the LINCS program officially ends\n(6/2020). Such a resource can be used for limitless applications, for example, to study molecular\nmechanisms of disease, repurpose existing drugs, predict side effects and indications for pre-clinical small\nmolecules, associate small molecules with the targets that they likely affect directly and indirectly,\nreconstruct cell signaling and gene regulatory networks, understand the global space of all possible cellular\nstates in response to all possible perturbations of all human cells, and many more applications and use\ncases. This utilization of LINCS resources is already happening but can be significantly enhanced via\ncontinued efforts led by the LINCS Data Coordination and Integration Center (DCIC) through interactions\nwith the CFDE and other CF DCCs in the next 3 years.\nSo far, the ~400 publications produced by the LINCS consortium have been cited by ~6,000 other papers,\ndemonstrating the high impact of the program on the research community. In particular, the computational\nresources developed by the LINCS DCIC have been very successful. These tools and databases were\nalready visited by >1 million unique users, with currently ~30,000 unique users per month (based on Google\nAnalytics). These strong usage statistics demonstrate the value of LINCS resources and their potential for\nmaking long-lasting impact on drug discovery, and the biomedical research community in general. The\nLINCS DCIC developed web-based resources to enable the federated access, intuitive querying, and\nintegrative analysis and visualization of the LINCS data combined with other relevant data. To achieve this\nthe LINCS DCIC also processed many additional external data types from other relevant resources to be\nintegrated with LINCS data including data from other Common Fund programs such as GTEx, Epigenomics\nRoadmap, and IMPC. However, such data integration efforts were achieved with little consideration of\ncommunity standards to ensure their long term findability, accessibility, interoperability and reusability\n(FAIR) (2). Our involvement with the NIH Data Commons Pilot Project Consortium (DCPPC) and the\nCommon Fund Data Ecosystem (CFDE) taught us many lessons on how to better achieve data\nharmonization via the adoption of community standards to achieve long term sustainability of LINCS\nresources. Hence, by interacting with the CFDE, adhering to the requirements that the CFDE will establish,\nwe will be able to reprocess the LINCS data, and the other data we use to integrate with LINCS, with\ntransformations that will enable improved FAIRness, further enabling more complex use cases.\nIn addition, by interacting directly with other CF DCCs we will enable the direct integration of LINCS data\nwith other CF generated resources. Our plan is to develop an interactive web-based data visualization\ncomponent that will enable users to project RNA-seq samples (patients, single cells, or signatures) into a\nlower dimensional space based on their transcriptomics data profiling. Such visualization will be linked to\nthe metadata describing each sample, as well as automatically identified clusters, enrichment analysis\nresults for each sample or cluster, and predictions of drugs and small molecules from the LINCS resource.\nThis interactive web-based data visualization component will enable, for example, assisting KidsFirst portal\nusers, including physicians, to prescribe the most appropriate therapeutics to the right subtype of patients,\nas well as trace patients over time to monitor their response to treatment enable decision support for\nchanging treatment course early, if necessary.\nFinally, by moving all LINCS resources into a cloud environment through STRIDES, we will ensure that\nLINCS resources are archived for the long term ensuring maximal reuse and enabling applications that are\ncurrently not even imagined or possible.",

The emerging spatial transcriptomics in Common Fund programs\nprovide invaluable insights into cellular diversity and tissue organization. However, integrating and analyzing\nthese diverse datasets remains a significant challenge. To address this gap, we propose developing new\nmachine learning methods to analyze spatial transcriptome data from multiple NIH Common Fund programs, in\nparticular, HuBMAP and SenNet. First, we will develop machine learning methods for integrative analysis of\nmultiple spatial transcriptome datasets. This will include creating a scalable, platform-agnostic framework using\npretrained single-cell RNA-seq foundation models to integrate diverse spatial transcriptome datasets and a\nmethod to analyze spatial gene programs across multiple samples. Second, we will develop machine learning\nmethods to reveal the underlying mechanisms of spatial gene expression. This will involve creating a\ntransformer-inspired model to disentangle intrinsic cellular factors from intercellular interactions and a\nframework to identify transcription factors modulating spatial gene programs. Collectively, the methods and\ntools developed in this project will significantly enhance the utility of existing NIH Common Fund spatial\ntranscriptomics datasets and facilitate integration with other related programs. This will drive forward our\nunderstanding of spatial gene regulation and its role in health and disease, aligning with the NIH Common\nFund’s mission to support transformative research with broad scientific impact.",

Asymmetry is a key feature of numerous developmental disorders including major structural birth\ndefects as well as neurological disorders. A better understanding of the genetic basis of asymmetry and its\nrelationship to disease susceptibility will help unravel the complex genetic and environmental factors and their\ninteractions that increase risk in a wide range of developmental disorders. The KOMP2 project aims to provide\ncomprehensive mouse knockout phenotype data, including 3D fetal imaging of sub-viable and lethal lines that\nare likely to play a significant role in development. In this project, automated, dense quantification of\nasymmetry of 3D embryonic microCT images will be used to build statistical models of asymmetry in normal\ndevelopment. Knockout strains will be screened for phenotypes with asymmetric structures or organs with the\ngoal of detecting genes associated with abnormally heightened asymmetry. The functional significance of the\nselected genes will be validated by comparing regions impacted in knockout strain phenotypes from the\nKOMP2 dataset to tissue expression data from the GTEx project. Candidate genes identified using biological\ninformation from the KOMP2 and GTEx datasets will be explored f or association with the KF whole genome\nsequencing data from OFC parent-case trios with the aim of identifying genetic variants that are enriched in\nthese groups compared to a control population. Identification of these variants will help shed light on the\nmechanisms linking congenital asymmetry and OFC risk. The outcomes of this study will include (1) statistical\nmodels of normal anatomy and asymmetry from the KOMP2 fetal 3D imaging data, (2) an open -source\nsoftware to produce detailed phenotype descriptions from dense morphometric analysis of 3D images from the\nKOMP2 dataset, (3) correlations between phenotype descriptions from the KOMP2 knockout strains and tissue\nexpression data from the GTEx project, and (4) analysis of the contribution of rare variants on candidate genes\ntowards OFC risk.",

The Library of Integrated\nNetwork-based Signatures (LINCS) P100 project has generated targeted (using 96 carefully chosen\nphosphosites) and comprehensive (using DIA, data independent acquisition) mass spectrometry (MS)-based\nphosphoproteomic datasets characterizing cell states perturbed using a collection of common bioactive\ntherapeutic (“known”) compounds. The analysis of phosphoproteomics data acquired using DIA is challenging,\nand as a result the comprehensive LINCS DIA data has not yet been leveraged to its full potential. The Molecular\nTransducers of Physical Activity (MoTrPAC) consortium has also used phosphoproteomics (along with other\nomics data) to quantify the molecular effects of exercise. Using methods like post-translational modification site-\nspecific enrichment analysis (PTM-SEA, Krug et al. MCP, 2019), perturbation-induced phosphorylation\nsignatures can be correlated with exercise-induced phosphorylation changes to identify known compounds that\ncan mimic the effects of physical activity, providing an exciting opportunity to enhance the combined utility and\nimpact of the LINCS and MoTrPAC Common Fund datasets.\nThe goal of our proposal is to test the hypothesis that there are known compounds that can mimic the effects of\nphysical activity. To accomplish this goal, the PTM signatures database (PTMsigDB) will be significantly\nexpanded using the LINCS DIA data.These signatures will then be correlated with phosphoproteomic changes\ninduced by physical activity provided by MoTrPAC to nominate exercise-mimetic drugs.\nWith these goals in mind we will 1) Develop and apply an automated, cloud-based pipeline to greatly expand\nphospho-perturbation profiles from existing LINCS data from 100 to several thousand distinct phosphosites; 2)\nDerive perturbation-specific phosphoproteomic signatures from the greatly expanded phospho-profiling data;\nand 3) Identify exercise mimetic drugs using PTM signature enrichment in MoTrPAC phosphoproteomic data\nfrom acute and long-term exercise. Successful application of the proposed strategy will nominate a list of\nexercise-mimetic drugs with the potential to initiate entirely new avenues of research focused on finding new\ntherapeutic approaches to combat aging or muscle wasting (cachexia) in cancer patients.",

      "abstract_text": "The Common Fund (CF) research initiative has generated a wealth of data that can provide vital context,\norigin, and, in some instances, quantitative inferences for biomarkers. However, the systematic harmonization\nand organization of biomarker data, as well as their connections to CF data, remain in an early stage and is\ncurrently the focus of the year-long Common Fund Data Ecosystem (CFDE) Biomarker-Partnership project that\naims to develop a working biomarker data model. The proposed BiomarkerKB project aims to refine and\npopulate the biomarker data model through a close and dynamic external partnership with the NCI-supported\nEarly Detection Research Network (EDRN) with built-in community input mechanisms. The initial focus is on\nrefining our current biomarker data model using EDRN's cancer biomarker data and knowledge. Initially\nfocusing on cancer will allow us to limit our scope while retaining the ability to evaluate a variety of data types\nand therefore ensure extensibility of the model as new data types and technologies emerge. The Minimal\nViable Product (MVP) will include persistent biomarker identifiers, linked data, connections to recognized\nstandards and ontologies, downloads/APIs, and data access through interfaces for biomarker explorations.\nThis data model will serve as the cornerstone for AI-ready datasets, machine learning-based biomarker\nprediction models, and biomarker knowledge graphs. The scientific use case the project proposes to support is\nthe ability to explore molecular biomarker-related knowledge for most prevalent cancers at a systems level,\ncategorized by biological functions through mapping to key ontologies, pathways, biomolecular data (glycans,\nproteins, genes, metabolites) and Electronic Health Record (EHR) terms and tests. Example biomarkers\n(including non-molecular ones that are of interest to Data Coordinating Centers (DCCs)) for other diseases will\nalso be considered to ensure the comprehensiveness and robustness of the data model. This project promises\nto enrich our understanding of the translational health record and intervention space, revolutionizing the way\nwe approach diverse diseases, clinical assays, molecular mechanisms, and disease classifications. The\npotential benefits extend to our partners in the EDRN and the broader CFDE community, underscoring the\nreal-world significance of biomarkers across the medical and research landscape.",

      "abstract_text": "The accessibility of information relevant for interpreting genetic variants. As the pace of WGS\naccelerates, the interpretation of the 99% of variants revealed by WGS that are non-coding is of\nincreasing importance. High-volume “omic” profiling datasets generated by Common Fund projects and\nderived information about specific variants and regulatory elements have great potential to inform the\ninterpretation of such non-coding variants. NIH CF Roadmap Epigenome, GTEx and CF Extracellular\nRNA Communication Consortium (CF ERCC) already generate publicly shareable information about the\nimpact of individual regulatory variants in the form of allele-specific DNA methylation, chromatin states,\ntranscription factor binding, phased allelic transcription, e/sQTL information, and transcription status of\nnon-coding and coding variants. More detailed information that may help evaluate functional effects of a\nvariant in specific haplotype and tissue contexts can be gleaned from privacy-protected multi-omic\nprofiles of biosamples containing the variant. Both the summary-level and the protected variant\ninformation is currently fragmented, poorly accessible and lacks interoperability.\nThe scope of this project. By\nleveraging resources from the CF ERCC\nand NHGRI ClinGen projects (Table 1),\nwe will unlock the value of variant\ninformation across Common Fund\nprojects. One immediate aim will be to\nimprove FAIRness of Extracellular RNA\nCommunication Consortium (ERCC)\ndata and make it accessible via the\nCFDE Data Portal. Additional two aims\ncut across CF projects and involve the\ndevelopment of infrastructure for\n“genomic indexing”, i.e., for aggregating\nvariant information across CF projects\nand for making the information FAIR and useful in both the research and clinical use cases. The\ninformation will be aggregated at the summary-level that does not compromise identity of participants and\nalso at the more detailed level that will be protected and will involve authorized access. We will initiate the\ncross-CF integration with variant information from Roadmap Epigenome, GTEx, and the Extracellular\nRNA Communication Consortium (ERCC) projects. In collaboration with GTEx (see letter from Dr. Kristin\nArdlie, GTEx PI), we will make the aggregated variant information accessible via web UIs and APIs\nhosted at the CFDE Data Portal.\nThe research and clinical diagnostic use cases. The research use cases will come from the NIH\nCommon Fund Gabriella Miller Kids First-KOMP2 (see letters from Dr. Bruce Gelb, KidsFirst-KOMP2 PI,\nand Dr. Sharon Plon, KidsFirst PI). The clinical diagnostic use cases will come from the NHGRI Clinical\nGenome Resource (ClinGen) project (see letter from Dr. Sharon Plon, ClinGen PI). In collaboration with\nthese projects, we will develop data models, data flows, system designs, and will participate in the\nvalidation of the systems. This collaboration between Drs. Gelb, Plon and Milosavljevic will build on\nseveral years of their previous collaboration within ClinGen where Dr. Gelb co-chairs the RASopathy\nExpert Panel and Drs. Plon and Milosavljevic serve on the ClinGen Steering Committee.\nFOA Areas addressed. As described below, our project will partner with CFDE-CC in the following two\nAreas listed in the FOA: Area 1 (Enabling access to, and computation across, multiple data sets in a\ncloud environment – addressed in this Section) and Area 3 (Enabling end-users to compute on data in the\ncloud – addressed in Section 2).",

      "abstract_text": "The accessibility of information relevant for interpreting genetic variants. As the pace of WGS\naccelerates, the interpretation of the 99% of variants revealed by WGS that are non-coding is of\nincreasing importance. High-volume “omic” profiling datasets generated by Common Fund projects and\nderived information about specific variants and regulatory elements have great potential to inform the\ninterpretation of such non-coding variants. NIH CF Roadmap Epigenome, GTEx and CF Extracellular\nRNA Communication Consortium (CF ERCC) already generate publicly shareable information about the\nimpact of individual regulatory variants in the form of allele-specific DNA methylation, chromatin states,\ntranscription factor binding, phased allelic transcription, e/sQTL information, and transcription status of\nnon-coding and coding variants. More detailed information that may help evaluate functional effects of a\nvariant in specific haplotype and tissue contexts can be gleaned from privacy-protected multi-omic\nprofiles of biosamples containing the variant. Both the summary-level and the protected variant\ninformation is currently fragmented, poorly accessible and lacks interoperability.\nThe scope of this project. By\nleveraging resources from the CF ERCC\nand NHGRI ClinGen projects (Table 1),\nwe will unlock the value of variant\ninformation across Common Fund\nprojects. One immediate aim will be to\nimprove FAIRness of Extracellular RNA\nCommunication Consortium (ERCC)\ndata and make it accessible via the\nCFDE Data Portal. Additional two aims\ncut across CF projects and involve the\ndevelopment of infrastructure for\n“genomic indexing”, i.e., for aggregating\nvariant information across CF projects\nand for making the information FAIR and useful in both the research and clinical use cases. The\ninformation will be aggregated at the summary-level that does not compromise identity of participants and\nalso at the more detailed level that will be protected and will involve authorized access. We will initiate the\ncross-CF integration with variant information from Roadmap Epigenome, GTEx, and the Extracellular\nRNA Communication Consortium (ERCC) projects. In collaboration with GTEx (see letter from Dr. Kristin\nArdlie, GTEx PI), we will make the aggregated variant information accessible via web UIs and APIs\nhosted at the CFDE Data Portal.\nThe research and clinical diagnostic use cases. The research use cases will come from the NIH\nCommon Fund Gabriella Miller Kids First-KOMP2 (see letters from Dr. Bruce Gelb, KidsFirst-KOMP2 PI,\nand Dr. Sharon Plon, KidsFirst PI). The clinical diagnostic use cases will come from the NHGRI Clinical\nGenome Resource (ClinGen) project (see letter from Dr. Sharon Plon, ClinGen PI). In collaboration with\nthese projects, we will develop data models, data flows, system designs, and will participate in the\nvalidation of the systems. This collaboration between Drs. Gelb, Plon and Milosavljevic will build on\nseveral years of their previous collaboration within ClinGen where Dr. Gelb co-chairs the RASopathy\nExpert Panel and Drs. Plon and Milosavljevic serve on the ClinGen Steering Committee.\nFOA Areas addressed. As described below, our project will partner with CFDE-CC in the following two\nAreas listed in the FOA: Area 1 (Enabling access to, and computation across, multiple data sets in a\ncloud environment – addressed in this Section) and Area 3 (Enabling end-users to compute on data in the\ncloud – addressed in Section 2).",

      "abstract_text": "The accessibility of information relevant for interpreting genetic variants. As the pace of WGS\naccelerates, the interpretation of the 99% of variants revealed by WGS that are non-coding is of\nincreasing importance. High-volume “omic” profiling datasets generated by Common Fund projects and\nderived information about specific variants and regulatory elements have great potential to inform the\ninterpretation of such non-coding variants. NIH CF Roadmap Epigenome, GTEx and CF Extracellular\nRNA Communication Consortium (CF ERCC) already generate publicly shareable information about the\nimpact of individual regulatory variants in the form of allele-specific DNA methylation, chromatin states,\ntranscription factor binding, phased allelic transcription, e/sQTL information, and transcription status of\nnon-coding and coding variants. More detailed information that may help evaluate functional effects of a\nvariant in specific haplotype and tissue contexts can be gleaned from privacy-protected multi-omic\nprofiles of biosamples containing the variant. Both the summary-level and the protected variant\ninformation is currently fragmented, poorly accessible and lacks interoperability.\nThe scope of this project. By\nleveraging resources from the CF ERCC\nand NHGRI ClinGen projects (Table 1),\nwe will unlock the value of variant\ninformation across Common Fund\nprojects. One immediate aim will be to\nimprove FAIRness of Extracellular RNA\nCommunication Consortium (ERCC)\ndata and make it accessible via the\nCFDE Data Portal. Additional two aims\ncut across CF projects and involve the\ndevelopment of infrastructure for\n“genomic indexing”, i.e., for aggregating\nvariant information across CF projects\nand for making the information FAIR and useful in both the research and clinical use cases. The\ninformation will be aggregated at the summary-level that does not compromise identity of participants and\nalso at the more detailed level that will be protected and will involve authorized access. We will initiate the\ncross-CF integration with variant information from Roadmap Epigenome, GTEx, and the Extracellular\nRNA Communication Consortium (ERCC) projects. In collaboration with GTEx (see letter from Dr. Kristin\nArdlie, GTEx PI), we will make the aggregated variant information accessible via web UIs and APIs\nhosted at the CFDE Data Portal.\nThe research and clinical diagnostic use cases. The research use cases will come from the NIH\nCommon Fund Gabriella Miller Kids First-KOMP2 (see letters from Dr. Bruce Gelb, KidsFirst-KOMP2 PI,\nand Dr. Sharon Plon, KidsFirst PI). The clinical diagnostic use cases will come from the NHGRI Clinical\nGenome Resource (ClinGen) project (see letter from Dr. Sharon Plon, ClinGen PI). In collaboration with\nthese projects, we will develop data models, data flows, system designs, and will participate in the\nvalidation of the systems. This collaboration between Drs. Gelb, Plon and Milosavljevic will build on\nseveral years of their previous collaboration within ClinGen where Dr. Gelb co-chairs the RASopathy\nExpert Panel and Drs. Plon and Milosavljevic serve on the ClinGen Steering Committee.\nFOA Areas addressed. As described below, our project will partner with CFDE-CC in the following two\nAreas listed in the FOA: Area 1 (Enabling access to, and computation across, multiple data sets in a\ncloud environment – addressed in this Section) and Area 3 (Enabling end-users to compute on data in the\ncloud – addressed in Section 2).",

      "abstract_text": "ABSTRACT\nRare variants are abundant in the human population and contribute to a variety of genetic diseases. However,\nidentifying impactful rare genetic variants from the multitude of inconsequential variants remains a challenge.\nTranscriptomics has emerged as a complementary assay to identify the effects of rare non-coding genetic\nvariants as approaches using gene expression outliers have assisted prioritization of rare variants involved in\nrare diseases. We have previously developed a machine learning model, Watershed, to prioritize candidate\ncausal rare variants by integrating outlier gene expression levels with relevant genomic annotations such as\nconservation and regulatory element annotations. This approach expands on variant effect prediction tools that\nare genome-only by further considering an individual’s transcriptome alongside their genome in the variant\nprioritization strategy. While previous approaches have focused on rare variant identification in regions\nproximal to the expression outlier gene, typically within 10kb, gene expression can be regulated in part by 3D\ngenomic conformation. Given increasing evidence that rare variants impact DNA architecture and 3D nuclear\norganization can influence the pathogenesis of rare disease, we hypothesize integrating genome topology will\nenable the identification of rare variants with functional activity that are more distal to the expression outlier\ngene. Our study aims to leverage Common Fund datasets to extend Watershed by utilizing 3D nucleome\ninformation from The 4D Nucleome (4DN) Program to prioritize causal rare variants in transcriptome data from\nThe Undiagnosed Disease Network (UDN) and The Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx) Project. Our\nproposed project will integrate cell-type specific and expression-matched annotations from dilution Hi-C\nexperiments in 4DN with RNA-Seq data from GTEx and UDN. We will assess rare variant enrichment in highly-\nconnected loci near gene expression outliers and develop Watershed-3D to utilize 4DN annotations to prioritize\nimpactful rare variants in healthy individuals and those with rare diseases. We will evaluate its performance\nusing N2 pairs, an approach we have previously applied to both GTEx and UDN, where two or more\nindividuals share the same rare variant and the predicted outlier score for one individual may be evaluated\nbased on the observed outlier status of the other individual(s) sharing the variant. Our outcome will be whether\n3D annotations improve rare variant detection compared with previous models that do not include genome\ntopology annotations and prioritize impactful, long-range rare regulatory variants in UDN samples. We will\nprovide the genomics community with annotations for rare variants in GTEx and UDN and an expanded\nWatershed-3D model in a reproducible, cloud-ready workflow. Combined, this proposal represents a significant\nopportunity to integrate our emerging understanding of nuclear topology and organization with genetic\ninformation to more systematically prioritize functional rare variant effects and their roles in health and disease.",

However, despite the comprehensiveness of these collections, understanding the rules dictating how CREs regulate genes remains a major unresolved problem in genomics. Therefore, to better understand gene regulation, we are proposing to develop a new framework where CRE-gene interactions are modeled as graphs. This will enable researchers to accomplish a wide range of computational tasks such as comparisons between cell types, predictions of new interactions, and predictions of gene expression. Specifically, this pilot project aims to evaluate the feasibility and generalizability of a CRE-interaction graph approach for predicting gene expression. We will build CRE-interaction graphs in three biological contexts using public datasets, including those generated by Common Fund projects, by integrating genomic interaction data, such as CRISPR perturbations and Hi-C loops, with annotated CREs. Then to demonstrate the utility of these graph models, we will use graph neural networks to predict gene expression, testing different algorithms and gene expression qualifications to maximize model performance. Finally, we will use feature attribution methods and prediction explainer algorithms to interpret our models to gain a better understanding of the mechanisms regulating transcription. The project will not only lead to a better model for predicting gene expression, but also establish a flexible framework for future research on gene regulation. The project will also produce a resource for the computational and machine learning community and improve the utility of existing resources.",

Therefore, it is much harder to both find relevant metabolomics datasets from repositories\nlike Metabolomics Workbench (MWbench) and effectively reuse these datasets to generate and/or test\nhypotheses. To address these difficulties in reusing metabolomics datasets, deposition quality must be\nimproved. Furthermore, methods that enable the effective search and harmonization of MWbench studies are\nneeded, especially for integrative multi-omics analyses. We are the developers of the only set of available open-\nsource tools for parsing, generating, and validating mwTab formatted repository files. Our experience developing\nand utilizing this open-source mwtab Python package makes us uniquely qualified to develop methods to\nimprove both deposition and FAIRness of MWbench studies. Also, we have provided periodic feedback to\nMWbench based on systematic evaluations of the repository to enable the improvement of this growing public\nresource (2). Therefore, we propose to develop methods and open-source tools that will improve deposition\nquality and FAIRness of MWbench through the following specific aims: Aim 1: Enable comprehensive capture,\ndeposition, and validation of metabolomics experimental data and metadata; Aim 2: Improve the FAIRness of\nMetabolomics Workbench while demonstrating effective multi-omics integration with the Genotype-Tissue\nExpression Project (GTEx). The major innovations that this proposal will develop are: i) effective metadata\ncapture methods from unstructured formats, ii) advanced search methods for relevant MWbench studies that\ncan filter on metadata quality, iii) effective harmonization methods for MWbench studies, iv) new omics\nintegration approach to detect human gene-metabolite associations, and v) new tools that facilitate public\ndeposition with high-quality metadata, with InChI tags, and in mwTab format for quicker, easier deposition.\n The significance of this proposal is in developing methods and tools that: a) comprehensively\ncapture, validate, and deposit metadata-rich metabolomics data, b) improve the FAIRness of MWbench datasets,\nespecially reuse, c) enable integration of MWbench and GTEx datasets to generate biomedically-relevant human\ngene-metabolite associations, and d) enable interpretation of gene-metabolite associations within molecular\ninteraction networks. These new tools will enhance the utility and usage of Metabolomics Workbench\nwhile demonstrating multi-omics integration with the Genotype-Tissue Expression Project.",

      "abstract_text": "Project Summary/Abstract\nInherited diseases are a major source of blindness. These diseases are typically single-gene disorders. Some\nmay cause developmental defects in early eye formation, others cause the degeneration of photoreceptor\ncells, while others may cause anterior segment disease. Historically they have been classified based on the\nclinical phenotype and then grouped into various disease entities. Retinitis pigmentosa (RP), an example of a\nrod-cone dystrophy, is the most common form of inherited retinal disease. It has a constellation of classical\nfindings observed on eye examination accompanied by progressive loss of rod and then cone photoreceptors\nleading to eventual blindness in late stages of the disease. In the past three decades the genetic basis of many\nforms of inherited retinal diseases, for example, have been discovered leading to the identification of over 270\nretinal disease genes. Mutations of over 80 genes are known to be associated with RP alone. However, in\nspite of the tremendous progress that has been made, the identification of the causative genetic alteration can\nbe identified in only 50-75% of patients with presumed inherited retinal disease, even after whole genome\nsequencing. Based on this fact, it is presumed that significant numbers of unknown ocular disease genes exist.\nOne approach to identify additional ocular disease genes in the mammalian retina is to take advantage of\nknockout mouse technology. The Knockout Mouse Phenotyping (KOMP) program is part of the International\nMouse Phenotyping Consortium (IMPC), a group of scientists from mouse clinics around the world with the\ncommon goal of creating single gene knockout mice for every gene in the mouse genome. To date, over 7,000\nsingle gene knockout mice have been created and phenotyped of the ~24,000 protein coding genes in the\nmouse genome. The UC Davis Mouse Biology Program is one of just three KOMP/IMPC centers in the US and\ngenerates a large number of knockout mice for the KOMP pipeline. Mouse knockouts receive comprehensive\nphenotyping in every organ system in the first four months of life prior to necropsy and histopathology.\nKnockout lines are annotated for dozens of specific eye abnormalities which are carefully documented during\nthe phenotyping process. Identification of ocular disease genes in knockout mice provides candidate eye\ndisease genes relevant in people. This proposal seeks to close the gap on the remaining 25-50% of patients\nwith presumed inherited ocular diseases that currently cannot be genetically diagnosed. In this project we will\nidentify all mouse retinal disease genes identified by the KOMP. In addition, we will correlate these novel\nmouse ocular disease genes for human relevance by cross referencing with the GTEx data base, also\nsupported by the Common Fund. Furthermore, we will deeply analyze the specific cell biology of novel genes,\nby literature search, Gene Ontology, Panther Pathway, STRING, Syscilia, CiliaCarta, and publicly available\nophthalmic GWAS. This proposal will catalyze discoveries and generate novel hypotheses based on clinically\nrelevant pathways previously unimplicated in eye disease.",

      "abstract_text": "Project Summary\nSubcellular localization, such as the nucleus lysosomes, and mitochondria, has tremendous potential to\nenhance the effectiveness of the therapeutic molecules rather than random distribution throughout the cell.\nWith improved subcellular localization and enhanced concentration, a specific molecule can be more\nefficacious as well as less toxic which is usually a concern of random distribution and nonspecific localization.\nTherefore, understanding subcellular distribution and the mechanism for a specific molecule can further\nmodulate subcellular dysfunction mediated diseases. Xenobiotic localization at the subcellular level has a\nprofound effect on several processes. The overarching goal of the proposed work is to develop a novel\nplatform with computational tools for specific xenobiotic localization. The proposed work will take advantage of\nthree common fund datasets. In specific aim-1, we aim to develop a suite of machine learning (ML) models for\nhierarchical levels of micro-compartmentation and 40 specific subcellular locations. These machine learning\nmodels will be first built using three different types of features (fingerprints-based, pharmacophore-based, and\nphysicochemical descriptors-based). Then, they are fused using an advanced multilayer combinatorial fusion\nalgorithm to get the best consensus model. We will also perform the scaffold analysis to identify critical\nscaffolds that play a role in accumulating molecules at specific subcellular locations. In specific aim-2, we will\nconduct experimental validation of the predictions developed ML models. More specifically we will test 50\ncompounds for their subcellular location. In specific aim-3, we plan to build an open portal that incorporates\ndatasets, ML model, prediction server, and documentation. All the data and models generated from the project\nare made available as open-source.",

      "abstract_text": "PROJECT SUMMARY\nDespite advances in our understanding of rare genetic diseases and their causes, only 8% of these diseases\nhave targeted drugs. Much of this arises from the disconnect between the inhibitory nature of drug molecules\nand a predominance of loss-of-function mechanisms in such diseases. There has been a growing appreciation\nof the role of gain-of-function variants in this context, especially towards drug repurposing. More specifically,\nwe and others have shown that even subtle changes in function such as alterations of post-translational\nmodification or molecular interaction sites can frequently lead to such disorders. It is unclear to what extent\nthese observations generalize and are actionable from a therapeutic perspective. Common Fund data sets\nsuch as those from the Gabriella Miller Kids First, Undiagnosed Disease Network, the Illuminating the\nDruggable Genome and LINCS programs provide a unique opportunity to assess this computationally. Our\ncentral hypothesis is that gain-of-function variants account for a much larger proportion of rare genetic\ndiseases than currently known and in silico functional profiling can be used to computationally identify such\ndiseases. The proposed work will test this hypothesis through two aims. In Aim 1, we will apply our previously-\ndeveloped predictors of variant impact towards the identification of known and predicted disease-associated\nvariants in large Common Fund genomic data sets. In Aim 2, we will subset out those variants that impact\ndruggable biochemical properties either directly or indirectly, to thus, infer novel drug-disease pairs. Over the\naward period, the principal investigator (PI) will leverage his and his team's expertise in variant interpretation,\nmachine learning and bioinformatics knowledgebases towards the systematic integration of genomic and drug-\nrelated data from multiple Common Fund data sets to identify candidate drugs that can be repurposed for rare\ngenetic diseases. This work will be carried out at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, home to world-\nrenowned researchers in human disease genetics, robust computational infrastructure, and a thriving\nbiomedical data science training environment. The proposed research will not only provide valuable pilot data\nfor experimental validation of promising drug repurposing candidates but will serve as the foundation for future\ncomputational methodology development that will expand the scope of variants and mechanisms that can be\nqueried. The work is expected to have broad impact, as it presents a new mechanism-centric, data-driven\napproach to identifying drug repurposing candidates for rare genetic diseases, that is generalizable to other\nsituations.",
      "project_title": "Variant impact prediction on Common Fund data sets towards drug repurposing for rare genetic diseases",
      "phr_text": "PROJECT NARRATIVE\nDrug repurposing has emerged as an important therapeutic strategy in the context of rare genetic diseases.\nDue to the mostly inhibitory nature of existing drug molecules, they are most effective on genetic variants that\nare likely to increase a protein's function, but the identification of such variants remains an open challenge. The\nobjective of the proposed research is to apply variant impact prediction methods and other computational\napproaches, on publicly available Common Fund data sets to: (1) identify disease-associated variants that\nincrease the propensity for specific biochemical functions in proteins, and (2) identify candidate drug molecules\nthat directly or indirectly inhibit these functions.",

Our\nteam offer 20+ years of combined experience in data repositories, data management, cloud computing, and\nFAIR data. We are excited for this opportunity to establish the CFDE ICC Sustainability Core (ICC-SC),\nto facilitate successful transition of CF program digital assets, including their datasets, software tools\nand workflows, as well as e-Learning materials. We are committed to sustain the wealth of knowledge\ncontributed by the CF programs via education, outreach, and dissemination programs. Our ICC-SC\nteam will serve as ambassadors to advocate and to champion the grand accomplishments of the CFDE\ncommunity. In view of our opportunities and challenges, we propose a CF program digital asset transfer\nstrategy with 3 specific aims as well as 7 supporting, interconnected, multi-dimensional, and action-packed\nmilestones and deliverables (see details in the section of Research Strategy).\nBriefly, to enable smooth digital asset transitioning efforts and to maximize dissemination and community re-\nuse, we define five action items to guide CF digital asset transfer: Meet, Assess, Transfer, Coordinate,\nHandover (MATCH). Meet. At launch, the ICC-SC, we will invite CF program representatives to meet with\nsuitable NIH IC-specific, specialized, and public repositories to identify challenges and opportunities in\n2-3 matchmaking conferences. Assess. The ICC-SC will help identify needs of both parties to collaborate on a\nstewardship plan following the devised diversity, equity, inclusion, and accessibility (DEIA) minded standard\noperation protocols (SOPs) for the CF Digital Asset Transfer. Transfer. The process of comprehensive and\nsecure digital transfer will begin with CF programs creating an inventory for all relevant digital files and\nmetadata. Coordinate. The ICC-SC will facilitate a transition period, coordinating closely with both parties\nto ensure smooth transition of stewardship. The ICC will monitor the secure relocation of assets and\nimplement backup, versioning, and recovery strategies where applicable. Handover. Following transition,\nresponsibilities will be handed over to the new steward, with partial ownership by CF programs negotiated\nwhere applicable. To facilitate MATCH, we will construct a web-based application, the “CFDE Digital Asset\nRepository Roadmap” linked under the CFDE portal; it will connect CF programs online with suitable IC-\nspecific, specialized, and public repositories. In collaboration with the Evaluation Core at ICC, we will\nimplement periodical review of our progress and we will refine our strategy to assure program success\nmoving forward. In summary, our efforts will showcase CF program success, amplify their impacts, and\nextend this invaluable treasure to benefit the wider biomedical community, and to inspire new innovations.",

At launch, the ICC-SC, we will invite CF program representatives to meet with\nsuitable NIH IC-specific, specialized, and public repositories to identify challenges and opportunities in\n2-3 matchmaking conferences. Assess. The ICC-SC will help identify needs of both parties to collaborate on a\nstewardship plan following the devised diversity, equity, inclusion, and accessibility (DEIA) minded standard\noperation protocols (SOPs) for the CF Digital Asset Transfer. Transfer. The process of comprehensive and\nsecure digital transfer will begin with CF programs creating an inventory for all relevant digital files and\nmetadata. Coordinate. The ICC-SC will facilitate a transition period, coordinating closely with both parties\nto ensure smooth transition of stewardship. The ICC will monitor the secure relocation of assets and\nimplement backup, versioning, and recovery strategies where applicable. Handover. Following transition,\nresponsibilities will be handed over to the new steward, with partial ownership by CF programs negotiated\nwhere applicable. To facilitate MATCH, we will construct a web-based application, the “CFDE Digital Asset\nRepository Roadmap” linked under the CFDE portal; it will connect CF programs online with suitable IC-\nspecific, specialized, and public repositories. In collaboration with the Evaluation Core at ICC, we will\nimplement periodical review of our progress and we will refine our strategy to assure program success\nmoving forward. In summary, our efforts will showcase CF program success, amplify their impacts, and\nextend this invaluable treasure to benefit the wider biomedical community, and to inspire new innovations.",

Our proposed\nengagements span the 3 key areas defined in the OT EOA and include GTEx, LINCS, HUBMAP, and\nSPARC as well as the activities the Kids First DRC is leading as part of the NIH Interoperability Working\nGroup to further the establishment of the Common Fund Data Ecosystem (CFDE).\nThe four investigators collaborating on this proposal have distinct professional backgrounds, areas of\nexpertise, and research tools at their disposal including leading the Kids First DCC/DRP and CAVATICA\nefforts.\nAt the Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia, Dr. Adam Resnick is a cancer and neuroscience research\nscientist with expertise in pediatric brain tumors and Dr. Allison Heath is a computer science expert in\nlarge-scale data bioinformatics and compute infrastructure. These experts will work together to lead the\nCHOP project team. At Centre Hospitalier Universitaire Sainte-Justine, Dr. Vincent Ferretti develops\nbioinformatics software for both large-scale software development and computational genomics. At Seven\nBridges, Dr. Jack DiGiovanna is an expert in cloud-based analysis platforms for bioinformatics that are\nscalable, collaborative, and reproducible.\nResponsibilities of Investigators\nAll PIs will share responsibility for ensuring the ethical conduct of the project, upholding the scientific\nintegrity of the project, administration, oversight and coordination of the project’s management.\nDr. Adam Resnick will serve as the contact PI. He will be responsible for the overall strategy, determining\nthe prioritization of scientific use cases, and ensuring that the project meets its goals of scientific impact.\nDr. Heath will oversee and facilitate the completion of the technical milestones and deliverables across all\nCDFE engagements. Dr. Heath will also be responsible for the execution of interoperability strategies with\nCFDE and the NIH IC Stacks. Dr. Ferretti will supervise the KFDRC portal development team and will be\nresponsible for all of their relevant deliverables, such as authentication with NIH RAS and visualization\nintegrations with LINCS. Dr. DiGiovanna will supervise the CAVATICA development team and will be\nresponsible for all of their relevant deliverables, such as GA4GH DRS integration and multi-cloud\ncapabilities.\nCommunication and Data Sharing\nThe PIs will communicate weekly and hold monthly teleconferences with PIs at the other organizations to\ndiscuss the CFDE and all administrative responsibilities. In addition, PIs will meet in person with all\npersonnel at least annually to assess progress and make major decisions about the direction of the\nprogram. If changes are warranted, PIs will work together to discuss those modifications and the\nredistribution of funds, if necessary. A publication policy will be established based on the relative scientific\ncontributions of the PIs and key personnel. Dr. Resnick will serve as contact PI and be responsible for\nsubmission of progress reports, annual reports to the NIH and all other communication.",

At Centre Hospitalier Universitaire Sainte-Justine, Dr. Vincent Ferretti develops\nbioinformatics software for both large-scale software development and computational genomics. At Seven\nBridges, Dr. Jack DiGiovanna is an expert in cloud-based analysis platforms for bioinformatics that are\nscalable, collaborative, and reproducible.\nResponsibilities of Investigators\nAll PIs will share responsibility for ensuring the ethical conduct of the project, upholding the scientific\nintegrity of the project, administration, oversight and coordination of the project’s management.\nDr. Adam Resnick will serve as the contact PI. He will be responsible for the overall strategy, determining\nthe prioritization of scientific use cases, and ensuring that the project meets its goals of scientific impact.\nDr. Heath will oversee and facilitate the completion of the technical milestones and deliverables across all\nCDFE engagements. Dr. Heath will also be responsible for the execution of interoperability strategies with\nCFDE and the NIH IC Stacks. Dr. Ferretti will supervise the KFDRC portal development team and will be\nresponsible for all of their relevant deliverables, such as authentication with NIH RAS and visualization\nintegrations with LINCS. Dr. DiGiovanna will supervise the CAVATICA development team and will be\nresponsible for all of their relevant deliverables, such as GA4GH DRS integration and multi-cloud\ncapabilities.\nCommunication and Data Sharing\nThe PIs will communicate weekly and hold monthly teleconferences with PIs at the other organizations to\ndiscuss the CFDE and all administrative responsibilities. In addition, PIs will meet in person with all\npersonnel at least annually to assess progress and make major decisions about the direction of the\nprogram. If changes are warranted, PIs will work together to discuss those modifications and the\nredistribution of funds, if necessary.

      "abstract_text": "Project Summary/Abstract:\nCardiorespiratory fitness (CRF) is an integrative measure of cardiopulmonary and metabolic health, and a\npowerful, independent predictor of future risk of mortality. No pharmacotherapies target CRF, and while\nexercise training (ET) remains the only established means to improve fitness, substantial inter-individual\nvariability exists in both its intrinsic (untrained) level as well as its response to ET. Limited information exists\nregarding CRF’s underlying biology and identifying its molecular underpinnings may help inform our\nunderstanding of the determinants of this clinically important trait. Emerging data highlight circulating\nbiochemicals, and in particular proteins, as mediators of exercise’s health benefits (“exerkines”).\nTo better understand the molecular pathways involved in exercise and CRF, the NIH Common Fund created\nMoTrPAC, the most comprehensive effort to study human exercise to date. MoTrPAC includes gold-standard\nmeasures of CRF (VO2max), and deep molecular profiling - including whole genome sequencing (WGS) and\nlarge-scale plasma proteomics. Moreover, the MoTrPAC study designs utilizes a randomized, controlled trial of\nET with a non-exercise control arm to allow for the identification of determinants of VO2max changes in\nresponse to ET (VO2max). Though the generation of large multi-omics data in MoTrPAC presents enormous\nopportunity, a major challenge remains in identifying the most promising biochemical determinants of CRF to\nbe brought forth for further, mechanistic studies. We and others have previously shown that integrating\ngenetics, proteomics, and functional genomics (e.g. tissue expression and knockout models) using statistical\ncolocalization can inform understanding about a protein’s regulation and suggest a causal role in health and\ndisease. These studies can, in effect, prioritize plasma proteins to be triaged for further investigation.\nThis proposal integrates plasma proteomics, WGS and VO2max traits from MoTrPAC with tissue expression\ndata from GTEx to prioritize candidate protein determinants of CRF. In Aim 1, we will apply a novel 5,000\nassay plasma proteomics platform (Olink5K) in ~1,980 MoTrPAC participants undergoing ET to identify\ncirculating proteins related to baseline VO2max and VO2max leveraging the non-exercise control arm in\nMoTrPAC. In Aim 2 we will: A) identify locally-acting (cis-) genetic instruments related to plasma proteins from\nAim 1 (cis-protein quantitative trait loci, pQTLs) from existing, publicly available datasets (TOPMed, UK\nBioBank) as well as generate new cis-pQTLs using WGS from MoTrPAC; and B) gain functional insights into\nthe genetic regulation of VO2max-related proteins through colocalization with tissue expression in GTEx\n(expression- or eQTLs). These experiments will help determine whether a plasma protein is regulated at the\ntranscriptional level and/or in tissues relevant to VO2max (e.g. heart, skeletal muscle) and set the stage for\nfurther mechanistic studies that extend beyond the scope of this project.",

      "abstract_text": "PROJECT SUMMARY\nPediatric cancer is the leading cause of disease-related death in children, yet very few drugs are specifically\nlabeled for pediatric malignancies, underscoring a need to identify novel molecular therapeutic targets to\nimprove outcomes for children with cancer, which is our long-term goal. Specifically, diffuse pediatric high-\ngrade gliomas (pHGGs) are resistant to multi-modal treatment and have had no new FDA-approved drugs in\nthe past 20 years, thus patients with these tumors are in urgent need of novel, effective therapeutic strategies.\nAberrant splicing contributes to neoepitope formation and represents a class of untapped targetable genetic\nalterations that are largely unexplored in pHGG. Our central hypothesis of this research plan is that aberrant\nsplicing events can result in tumor-specific neoepitopes in pHGGs and these data can be rapidly harnessed\nand prioritized for therapeutic targeting. The proposed work will test this hypothesis with two integrated specific\naims: 1) identify putative immunotherapeutic subtype-specific splice targets in pHGGs and 2) characterize\naberrant splice variation in pHGG preclinical models and validate immunotherapeutic splice targets for\npreclinical testing. These studies will integrate transcriptional splice events with tumor tissue expression (PBTA\nand Kids First X01), normal tissue expression (GTEx and available pediatric matched tissue normals), peptide\nsequences (UniProt), and known extracellular domain annotations (UniProt) to identify and prioritize\nneoepitopes generated in pHGGs. This work will elucidate novel splice-driven immunotherapeutic targets\nthrough rigorous integrative computational analysis of splice variation in pHGG tumors, coupled with\northogonal molecular assays, to validate presence and expression of these targets. The successful completion\nof this project will generate significant new knowledge of aberrant splicing programs in pHGG and will identify\npotential immunotherapeutic targets. This work is critical to understanding the genetic contributions of aberrant\nsplicing to pediatric cancer, will enable the research and clinical communities to rationally inform novel\nimmunotherapeutic strategies for pHGG, and will serve as a roadmap for investigation of neoepitopes in other\npediatric brain tumors. This work is highly relevant to the critical mission of the National Cancer Institute to\nadvance scientific knowledge and identify novel strategies to improve overall survival of cancer patients.",

      "abstract_text": "Project Summary\n Exercise offers profound systemic benefits, leveraging multiple molecular pathways and mechanisms to\nenhance health. Exercise interventions have been shown to improve symptoms in cancer, cardiovascular\ndiseases, and neurodegenerative disorders. Molecular mechanisms of exercise in disease prevention and\nreversal include anti-inflammatory effects and improved immune function, hormonal regulation, reduction of\noxidative stress, and improved metabolic function. There is a growing body of literature on the individual\npathways activated by exercise in specific disease cases, but a comprehensive investigation across the whole\nbody is needed to identify pathways and molecules of interest to mediating the systemic benefits of exercise\nand complex interorgan communication.\n The Molecular Transducers of Physical Activity Consortium (MoTrPAC) has generated an invaluable\nresource for identifying molecular changes in response to exercise. We will leverage their exercised rat\nprofiling (naive, 1, 2, 4, 8 weeks post treadmill). This dataset is unique in being multi-modal and multi-organ\nallowing us to capture the broadest repertoire of exerkines and co-profile the expression of their receptors\nwithin the same organ and across organs. We will compare these findings to profiles from healthy (GTEx and\nHuBMAP) and diseased (including HTAN and psychENCODE) humans.\n We propose to define a comprehensive, multi-organ catalog of exerkines. Using public databases, we\nwill pair the exerkines with their receptors when known, revealing the whole-body landscape of\nexercise-induced signaling. For each organ, we will cross-reference the exerkine and receptor molecules with\nthe relevant diseased and healthy human dataset to uncover overlapping pathways between disease\ndysregulation and exercise modulation. We will bioinformatically simulate single-cell expression data to predict\nexerkine and receptor cell types, and further predict cell-cell interactions, validating candidate receptor ligand\ninteractions by spatial omics assays in the healthy and cancerous human intestine. We will:\nAim 1. Generate and identify exerkines and receptors for 17 organs in MoTrPAC.\nAim 2. Decode exerkines and receptors inter- and intracellular signaling events and synergistic cell-cell\ncommunication\nAim 3. Analyze response of exerkines to disease in humans",

This gap of knowledge delays the progress in risk assessment and therapeutic\nstrategies for sex-aware precision healthcare. While studies have shown significant sex\ndifferences in the genetic architectures of complex diseases, most investigators opted to do sex-\ncombined analyses in disease genetic studies to maximize statistical power. NIH recently began\nto reinforce the inclusion of sex as a biological variable in the design, analysis, and reporting of\nvertebrate animal and human studies. Insights into the functional genetic bases of sex as a\nbiological variable are critical to develop therapeutic interventions that equally benefit each sex.\nWe recently found that ~1% variants in the population have sex-biased allele frequency, including\n~10% of disease variants in the Genome Aggregation Database (gnomAD). These variants\npreferentially occur in tissue-specific sex-differentially expressed genes. We propose a novel\napproach to study sex differences in disease genetic architectures by leveraging variants that are\nsex-biased either in allele frequency or phenotypic association. We believe this approach will\nincrease the statistical power to identify sex-specific or sex interacting causal variants in sex-\nbiased diseases. We will identify and characterize sex-biased variants in gnomAD, Genotype-\nTissue Expression project (GTEx) and Trans-Omics for Precision Medicine for sleep disordered\nbreathing phenotypes and venous thromboembolism case-control datasets. We will subsequently\nstudy the functional mechanisms of these sex-biased variants in ~50 GTEx tissues. The\ncompletion of this pilot study will advance future genetic studies of sex-divergent disorders and\naccelerate the realization of sex-aware genomic medicine.",

      "abstract_text": "PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT\nMolecular Transducers of Physical Activity (MoTrPAC), Nutrition for Precision Health (NPH), and the Human\nHealth Exposure Analysis Resource (HHEAR) are NIH-funded national projects (three originating from NIH\nCommon Fund initiatives) that measure thousands of metabolites in large cohorts of human subjects under\nexercise, diet, environmental exposure conditions respectively. The Common Fund initiated Metabolomics\nWorkbench, which serves as the data repository, the metabolomics harmonization center and the data analytics\nworkbench for deep analyses of human metabolomics and provides the infrastructure to develop the concept of\nhuman metabotype. We characterize the metabolomic state of groups of individuals with common homeostatic\npoints for a collection of metabolites as “human metabotypes”. More precisely, the metabotype defines a\ncollection of metabolites or metabolite classes that is unique (in the metabolomic hyperspace) to a class of\nindividuals – defined in this project through metabolomics measurements from humans subject to exercise and\ndiet perturbations and humans subject to distinct environmental exposures. Human subjects can be classified\nas belonging to one of several distinct groups (e.g., clusters in a UMAP) defining the metabotype for a chosen\nset of metabolites in a class. At the quantitative level, the distinct groups are defined by distinct profiles of\nmetabolites or metabolite classes.\nThe major goal of this project is to use the three national projects to develop the “metabotype” concept into a\nconcrete set of points in the metabolomics hyperspace that define the human physiological state. Towards this,\nwe harmonize the metabolomics data across the national projects, identify the clusters of metabolites/metabolite\nclasses that define a group of human subjects, and provide the biological context to the metabotype. The tools\nwe will develop will enable an end user to analyze and decipher the physiological function that further defines\nthe metabotype and explore perturbations such as exercise, diet, or changing environment to see how the\nhomeostatic endotype points change into another possible homeostatic state.\nMost importantly, given that the definition of the endotypes in the MoTrPAC, NPH and HHEAR projects largely\nrefer to healthy human subjects, we will develop the ability for any individual with their metabolomic\nmeasurements to map their data on the metabotype space. Using such a “Metabotype Calculator”, the most\nvaluable product of this project, a human subject will be able to assess their “state of health” and assess how\nperturbations such as exercise or diet will alter their homeostatic metabotype states. We anticipate that the\n“Metabotype Calculator” will serve as a dynamic living counterpart to the genotype in defining the human\nsubject’s state of physiology. All the resources developed in this project will be available on the Common Fund\nData Ecosystem Data Repository Center (CFDE DRC). The Principal Investigator (PI) of this U24, also the CFDE\nDRC PI, will facilitate making this resource available to the user community.",

      "phr_text": "PROJECT NARRATIVE\nMetabolites are often endpoints and markers of human physiology, and a collection of metabolites can potentially\ndefine homeostatic states of human health. We bring together metabolomics measurements on human subjects\nfrom three defined perturbations, namely, exercise, diet, and environmental exposome, from the three national\nprojects, MoTrPAC, NPH, and HHEAR, respectively, in defining the metabotypes (homeostatic states) through\nexploration of the metabolomic hyperspace. We hypothesize that, from large-scale metabolomic measurements\non humans, we can define metabotypes that define the homeostatic state of a collection of metabotypes and\ndefine how perturbations from this state can be addressed through targeted interventions and provide the\nmetabotype calculator as the most valuable product from this project.",

This study will focus on analysis of oral-facial clefts, congenital diaphragmatic\nhernia, and congenital heart defects from whole-genome sequencing (WGS) data from family cohorts taken\nfrom Gabriella Miller Kids First Pediatric Research Project (KF).\n Typically, tests to link disorders to genome-wide complex multivariate associations are computationally\nprohibitive. Thus, a first step to making such analyses more reasonable is to limit the number of variables\n(genes, variants) being tested together. We can reduce the number of possible tests by restricting what data\nshould be tested. This study will seek to reduce the data for testing by utilizing biological knowledge from other\ntwo Common Fund datasets: the Knockout Mouse Phenotyping Program (KOMP2), and the Genotype-Tissue\nExpression (GTEx) project. KOMP2 has generated extensive information on mouse knockout developmental\nphenotypes relevant for matching gene and phenotypes in KF WGS studies. GTEx can be merged with KF loci\nand relevant tissue-to-phenotype relationships. Thus, using features from other Common Fund data and\nannotations, we can generate selected subsets of KF variants and genes as feature-reduced KF data.\n A comprehensive machine learning (ML) analysis pipeline will then be utilized for the identification of\ncandidate risk factors and characterization of complex patterns of association between these feature-reduced\nKF data. In addition to performing the more traditional univariate association analyses of genotype vs.\nphenotype, this pipeline will also identify complex associations including (1) context-dependent genetic effects\nresulting from non-additive multi-variant interactions, i.e. epistasis, and (2) subgroup-specific associations, i.e.\nby phenotype and genotypic heterogeneity, where different etiological paths lead to the same/similar\nphenotypes in the selected KF subject group. This pipeline will include feature selection, modeling, and\ninterpretation of multi-variant interactions.\n The outcomes of this study will include (1) pipelines for integrating Common Fund data into Kids First\ndatasets, (2) integrated KF-KOMP2-GTEx datasets including cross-species integration, (3) ML pipelines for\nmulti-variant interaction analyses of phenotype vs genotype in selected, reduced-feature KF data, and (4) results\nfrom the aforementioned pipelines for multi-variant interactions for later hypothesis testing.",

      "abstract_text": "Project Summary\nThe proposed study seeks to identify genomic features that explain epidemiological co-occurrences of childhood\ncancers (CCs) and structural birth defects (SBDs). We will import germline and genomics data from affected\ncohorts into the Common Fund Data Ecosystem (CFDE) Data Distillery Knowledge Graph (DDKG) project, an\nongoing CFDE project that generated a comprehensively annotated graph database built with empirical data\nfrom 11 Common Fund projects with over 40 million data points and 300 million relationships, and which utility\nhas been proven through successful applications of several complex use cases.\nOur goals for this proposal are first to expand and update the DDKG schema to support a broader spectrum of\ngenomic data types and edge (relationship) weighting by evidence level. This expansion will expand the DDKG’s\ninformation capacity and better support machine learning applications on extracted data. Datasets chosen from\nthis project are based on epidemiological observations on the relationships between congenital heart defects\nand neuroblastoma or hematological malignancies, and brain or CNS congenital defects and brain tumors. Data\nfrom representative cohorts with any or both selected CCs and SBDs will be obtained from the Kids First project\nas germline and tumor data. We will also incorporate genomics data from the NCI Molecular Targets Project into\nthe DDKG, representing a comprehensive repository of childhood cancer genomics data produced by the lead\nprincipal investigator.\nWe will analyze the DDKG data for predicted relationships between SBDs and CCs with strategies including\ntopological link prediction methods, the Connect the Dots algorithm, dimensionality reduction methods (such as\nembeddings) with cluster detection, and machine learning with PyG’s support for Graph Neural Networks (GNNs)\nfor heterogeneous graphs. User data delivery will be accomplished with the DDKG project’s pre-built tools, and\nby developing and refining innovative data delivery methods. This will enhance the accessibility of the project's\nfindings and extend the utility of the DDKG for the broader research community.\nWith the analysis of large-scale pediatric cohort genomics data, we seek to set a precedent for large-scale\ngenomics data analyses using Common Fund Data while providing significant insights into the genetic drivers of\nCCs and SBDs, paving the way for future research and clinical applications. Other researchers can utilize the\nDDKG with our methodology developments, increasing the opportunities to reuse CFDE data.",

      "abstract_text": "Scientific Abstract\nAs the leading cause of cancer death in the United States, lung cancer accounts for about 20% of all cancer\ndeaths. While there are two major types of lung cancer (i.e., 80%~85% for non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC)\nand 10%~15% for small cell lung cancer (SCLC)), each type of lung cancer has multiple distinct subtypes\ncharacterized by morphological, molecular, and genetic alterations. Identifying lung cancer subtypes can\nfacilitate downstream risk stratification and tailored treatment design. While various conventional methods like\nmorphological analysis, computed tomography (CT) and imaging techniques, cytogenetic analysis,\nimmunophenotyping, or molecular profiling have been used for lung cancer subtype identification, they are\nusually costly, time-consuming, labor-intensive, and sometimes inaccurate. Recent progress has witnessed the\napplication of next generation sequencing (NGS) for identifying lung cancer subtypes, but they are limited to bulk\nNGS data, or single omics data only. With tons of omics data being generated within and beyond the Common\nFund data sets (e.g., GTEx and HuBMAP), we hypothesize that integration of single-cell and bulk multi-omics\ndata including genomics, transcriptomics, and epigenetics data will significantly facilitate subtype-specific\nbiomarker discovery and boost the accuracy of lung cancer subtype identification. To address these concerns,\nwe propose to develop an integrated machine learning (ML) framework for accurate and cost-effective\nlung cancer subtype identification by combining single-cell and bulk multi-omics data within and beyond\nCommon Fund data sets. To achieve this, two specific aims are undertaken. Aim 1, to establish a gene-\nsignature-transfer ML model that leverages large-scale bulk and single-cell transcriptomics data within and\nbeyond Common Fund data sets for lung cancer subtype identification. Besides identifying well-annotated lung\ncancer subtypes, we will also explore novel lung cancer subtypes by detecting rare cell types from large-scale\nsingle cell data, from which cluster-specific and rare-cell-type specific gene signatures can be transferred to the\nbulk transcriptomics data for improving performance of lung cancer subtype identification. Aim 2, to develop a\nmulti-omics integration framework to systematically combine single-cell and bulk multi-omics data (including\ngenomics, transcriptomics, epigenomics) to further boost lung cancer subtype identification. Our model is flexible\nto tackle cases when only partial or incomplete multi-omics data are available for new patients. We believe\nsuccessful completion of this study will have direct impacts on improving downstream lung cancer risk\nstratification, facilitating diagnosis and prognosis, and optimizing treatment selection. We also expect that our\nproposed framework in this study can be customized and extensible to identifying subtypes of other types of\ncancer.",

      "abstract_text": "Understanding and decoding the intricacies of gene regulatory networks is crucial in genomics for insights into\ngene expression and cellular functions. Traditionally, research in this field has heavily relied on transcriptome\ndata and machine learning to infer these networks, but this approach has mostly used bulk tissue samples. This\nmethod overlooks the nuances of individual cells and their microenvironments, limiting our understanding to a\nbroader, macroscopic level.\nThe advent of spatial transcriptomics marks a significant shift, promising to unravel these networks at a single-\ncell and spatial level. This technology allows for the exploration of gene expression in relation to spatial dynamics,\nenhancing our understanding of tissue organization and cellular functions.\nHowever, adapting machine learning to spatial genomics faces challenges. One major issue is the scarcity of\nspatial transcriptome data, which hampers the effectiveness of deep learning methods known for their superiority\nin network estimation. Another challenge is the need for models that account for the physical positions of cells,\nas traditional methods treat data as independent and identically distributed, ignoring spatial relationships.\nTo address these challenges, this proposal outlines two main objectives:\nAim 1: Developing deep learning methods for cell-type resolution regulatory network estimation capable\nof transferring between scRNA-seq and spatial transcriptomics data. We will develop machine learning\nmdoels that can integrate components that explicitly model the regulatory network, distinguishing cell types\nbased on transcriptomic data. The approach will use domain-invariant regularization to adapt from scRNA-seq\nto spatial transcriptomics, employing GTEx and HuBMap data sets.\nAim 2: Developing deep learning methods with spatial regularization for estimating regulatory networks\nat spatial resolution within spatial transcriptomics. We will develop techniques that factor in the spatial\npositioning of cells during the learning process. The hypothesis is that cells in close spatial proximity have similar\nregulatory structures. This aim will also use GTEx and HuBMap data, along with collaborative efforts on spatial\ntranscriptome data of the human dorsolateral prefrontal cortex.\nOverall, this proposal seeks to lead the development of advanced deep learning models, integrating cell-type\nresolution and spatial dimensions to revolutionize our understanding of regulatory networks in genomics to both\nthe cell-type and spatial resolution.",

      "abstract_text": "PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT\nThe NIH Common Fund Genotype-Tissue Expression project (GTEx) collected whole-genome sequencing and\ngene expression data from 47 tissues sites of hundreds of subjects. It generated a huge impact by providing\ntissue-level gene expression and expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs) for over 7,000 publications. However,\ntissues are mixtures of myriad cells, and tissue-level gene regulation is affected by cellular compositions. To\nobtain cell-type-specific (CTS) effects, GTEx started to collect single-nucleus RNA-sequencing (snRNA-seq)\ndata from eight tissue types. The single-cell data collection is extremely expensive and labor-intensive, and thus\nsnRNA-seq data are only collected from 25 tissue samples of 16 donors that may not represent the population.\nMore cost and labor-efficient methods are urgently needed to use existing datasets fully. It turns out that with\nanother NIH Common Fund project, Human BioMolecular Atlas Program (HuBMAP), we can gain population-\nlevel insights with HuBMAP single-cell data as a reference by developing computationally efficient\nmethods. Complementary to GTEx and other single-cell references, the HuBMAP single-cell reference\nallows us to deconvolve the 47 GTEx tissues into over 200 cell types. In addition to the cellular fractions, we\nwill calculate CTS eQTLs for those cell types at a population scale. Specifically, we will: 1) estimate cellular\nfractions of over 200 cell types from 47 tissue sites across the human body; 2) calculate CTS-eQTLs for those\nhundreds of cell types with statistical rigor and power. We will further consider the potential selection bias in\nthe eQTL analysis that GTEx collected only normal tissues. The successful completion of this project will\nmaximize the usage of NIH Common Fund GTEx and HuBMAP projects to provide a new eQTL resource at\ncell-type resolution. It will be powerful in downstream analyses such as CTS colocalization by connecting with\ngenome-wide association studies (GWAS) and CTS transcriptome-wide association studies (TWAS) by\npredicting genetically regulated CTS gene expression. Altogether, this project will provide a global picture of\nthe human body at high resolution to map cells to health and complex diseases.",

      "abstract_text": "ABSTRACT\nThe gut microbiome plays a critical role in the pathogenesis of human diseases through their metabolites,\nacting as a dynamic interface between our environment and health. Recent paired microbiome-metabolome\nstudies enable the simultaneous analysis of hundreds of microbes and metabolites, uncovering their associa-\ntions with various conditions in unprecedented detail. Integrative analyses of paired microbiome-metabolome\ndata sets require multivariate models that can account for complex correlation structures between microbes\nand metabolites. However, these multivariate models face the challenge of low statistical power for detecting\nmicrobiome-metabolome interactions due to small sample sizes and weak biological signals. Therefore, the\noverarching goal of the proposed research is to develop novel statistical methods for the powerful detection\nof weak microbiome-metabolome interactions with limited data. In Aim 1, we will develop a powerful transfer-\nlearning framework for high-dimensional regression models with composition covariates. Unlike most existing\ntransfer-learning methods that borrow information from external data sets, our framework leverages the simi-\nlarities across metabolites within a single cohort. This will help minimize the potential risk of negative transfer,\ngiven the different sequencing platforms and bioinformatic pipelines used in different studies. In Aim 2, we apply\nour transfer-learning method to the human microbiome project (HMP), the integrative human microbiome project\n(iHMP), and an external paired microbiome-metabolome data set. Our analyses will reveal biologically relevant\nmicrobiome-metabolome interactions for both healthy people and patients diagonosed with inflammatory bowel\ndisease (IBD), advancing our understanding of the microbiome-IBD link. Furthermore, we will analyze biopsy-\nspecific microbiome-metabolome interactions for IBD patients, revealing potential spatial heterogeneity for IBD-\nassociated microbiome and metabolites. This proposed research is distinguished by its originality in introducing\nnovel, powerful, and flexible transfer-learning frameworks and novel applications of microbiome-metabolome\ninteractions in both healthy and IBD populations.",

      "abstract_text": "PROJECT SUMMARY\nOver the past decade, thousands of genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have been performed, greatly\nimproving our understanding of the genetic origins of complex diseases. A large number of variants have been\nassociated with individual traits, but a complete understanding of complex disease remains elusive, due in\nlarge part to two unsolved challenges. First, a majority of associated variants are noncoding and distant from\nthe nearest gene, complicating their interpretation. Second, the observed heritability of many complex diseases\nfar exceeds the portion which can be explained by GWAS-discovered variants, largely because of the\ncombined effects of rare variants unprobed by current techniques and common variants falling below\nsignificance thresholds of existing GWAS methods. As whole-genome sequencing and rare variant discovery\nbecome increasingly prevalent, frameworks for functionally annotating rare variants and associating them with\ndisease-associated driver genes and pathways will become increasingly important. A wealth of public\nepigenetic data exists, including collections of chromatin modification profiles and 3D structure data from\nvarious Common Fund sources as well as external consortia. In combination with whole-genome sequencing\ndata, these datasets offer great potential to further our understanding of diseases across the spectrum from\nMendelian to complex diseases.\nAs members of the ENCODE Project, we have developed the Registry of candidate cis-Regulatory Elements\n(cCREs), a collection of nearly a million candidate enhancers, promoters, and insulators in the human genome\nwith activity profiles in more than 800 human cell types. In parallel, we collaborated with Prof. Xihong Lin on\nthe development of variant-Set Test for Association using Annotation infoRmation (STAAR), a framework for\nperforming rare-variant association tests using functional annotations and a dynamic weighting scheme. Here\nwe aim to extend the Registry of cCREs to include gene regulatory networks, including gene-enhancer links,\n3D chromatin neighborhoods, co-expressed gene networks, and biochemical pathways, drawing on data from\nthe Common Fund, including GTEx and the 4DNucleome Project, and other public sources (Aim 1). We then\naim to extend GWAS and the STAAR methodology to incorporate these higher-order features to identify novel\ngene regulatory network associations with disease-associated rare variants (Aim 2). In this study, we will focus\non three human congenital disorders, cleft lip/palate (CLP), congenital diaphragmatic hernia (CDH), and\nventricular septal defect (VSD), as these disorders have extensive whole-genome sequencing data by the\nGabriella Miller Kids First Pediatric Research Consortium. We will validate our results using Knockout Mouse\nPhenotyping Program (KOMP2). In summary, we will discover new disease-gene associations, produce a\nframework broadly applicable to existing and future whole-genome sequencing datasets, and improve the\nutility and accessibility of four select Common Fund datasets (GTEx, 4DNucleome, KOMP2, and Kids First).",

      "phr_text": "PROJECT NARRATIVE\nGenome-wide association studies are increasingly moving toward rare variant discovery and whole-genome\nsequencing in order to discover sources of missing heritability and identify novel genetic contributors to\ncomplex diseases, and computational frameworks for functionally annotating rare variants will be critical to\nderive meaningful biological findings from these datasets as they are produced. We propose to build upon our\nexisting computational methods and resources, integrating the wealth of Common Fund and public genomic\nand epigenomic data to develop a comprehensive, novel framework for linking rare variants with gene\nregulatory networks. We will pilot this framework by analyzing datasets for three congenital human disorders\nfrom the Kids First collection, aiming to discover novel gene regulatory associations with these disorders and\nfurther our understanding of their genetic origins.",

Mouse lines categorized as cellular lethal, developmental lethal\nor subviable are targeted as relevant for early and severe pediatric phenotypes.

The second\ncohort consists of patients admitted to the pediatric intensive care units (ICUs) within the first 100 days of life.\nThe third cohort is a recent sample of pediatric patients with trio exome data available. The fourth cohort is a\npediatric cohort with likely Mendelian disease genes of unknown function. With each cohort we will identify\nvariants of uncertain significance in human orthologues corresponding to mouse genes classified as cellular\nlethal, developmental lethal or sub-viable.

      "abstract_text": "PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT\nUniProt is one of the foundational resources for understanding the molecular details of the inner life of the cell.\nAs a hub for knowledge of protein sequence and function, UniProt organizes knowledge from biomedical\nliterature, integrates datasets with curated knowledge, and serves as an exemplar FAIR and TRUST resource\nreused by hundreds of other data resources. The Common Fund (CF) program brings together diverse\ncollections of valuable biomedical data, yet still needs to be connected with the major data repositories\necosystem to uncover its full potential for discovery and innovation. In this application we will strengthen the\nprotein-centric connectivity of UniProt to multiple CF Data Coordinating Centers (DCCs) and the Data Resource\nCenter (DRC) in the Common Fund Data Ecosystem (CFDE), and will collaborate with two CF DCCs, the\nKnockout Mouse Phenotyping Program (KOMP2) and the Cell Maps for AI (CM4AI) Project of the Bridge to\nArtificial Intelligence (Bridge2AI) Program. The collaboration will support CFDE data integration and reuse, while\nbuilding new capabilities to interrogate and understand complex biological systems and cell networks for deeper\nunderstanding of responses to perturbations at the systems level. To foster biomedical discovery through the re-\nuse of CF data and enable novel scientific research that was not possible before, we will increase the connectivity\nand data integration between UniProt and CF datasets. We will create a new form-based mechanism to link with\nCF data resources, starting with several already identified for targeted integration. We will extend the UniProt\nmapping service, allowing researchers to identify data of interest through protein-centric search and promote\ninteroperability at the protein level across the CF ecosystem. We will develop new tools, APIs and workflows\nwith easy access and navigation for researchers to interrogate and understand complex biological systems and\ncell networks. It will allow seamless bidirectional navigation of data from whole subcellular systems to functional\npathways and interacting proteins and vice versa. We will hold annual workshops to broaden collaborations with\nthe CFDE and engagement with the research community. We will incorporate user feedback throughout the tool\ndevelopment lifecycle and implement an integration plan with the CFDE for dissemination and long-term\nsustainability. We aim to understand systems-level responses to perturbations through genotype-phenotype\nmapping and metabolic and signaling network discovery. We will integrate relevant datasets, tools, and literature\nand extend our knowledge graph learning algorithm for link prediction in a drug discovery use case. We will build\ncustomized knowledge graphs with various use scenarios, incorporating scientific questions from the\ndemonstration project and user engagement. This UniProt-CF partnership will support functional genomics\ntowards fundamental biological systems understanding and the development of new diagnostics and therapies.",

CTCF\nprotein regulates the genome organization through cohesin complex-mediated loop extrusion mechanism. While\na few more factors have been recently discovered to regulate genome organization, such as NIPBL, WAPL, YY1,\nZNF143, and MAZ, it is still far from a comprehensive mechanistic understanding of how the genome is organized.\nDiscovering novel regulators of genome organization is still challenging due to the intensive nature of chromatin\nconformation capture technologies. To address the technical challenge in measuring genome organization, we\nhave recently demonstrated that a deep neural network approach can enable de novo prediction of cell type-\nspecific chromatin organization at high resolution. Moreover, this deep neural network model enables high-\nthroughput in silico genetic screen (ISGS) for identifying cell type-specific DNA elements that are important for\nchromatin interactions. To fully unlock the discovery potential of this deep neural network-based ISGS approach,\nhere we propose to leverage the NIH Common Fund-supported large-scale genomic data across human bio-\nsamples for discovering novel regulators in 3D genome organization. We will predict a list of high-confidence\ntrans-acting regulators, and experimentally validate 3-5 top hits in pilot studies to generate cross-cutting\nhypotheses for future research in 3D genome regulation.",

      "abstract_text": "SUMMARY\n The Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx) Program studies the impact of genetic variants\non gene expression in many human cell types and tissues. To identify the expression\nquantitative trait loci (eQTLs) of each gene, the genetic variants within one million base pairs (1\nMb) of the transcription start site (TSS) of the gene are considered as the candidates, and then\nthe GTEx computational pipeline identifies the significant candidates as eQTLs of the gene. This\n1 Mb threshold is being widely used as the gold standard in the field to reduce multiple tests.\nUsing this threshold assumes that genetic variants outside of this distance contribute little to\ngene expression, and thus are unlikely to be eQTLs. However, we observed that, on average,\n10% of cis-regulatory elements (CREs) are outside of the 1 Mb threshold, herein referred to as\ndistal CREs. Therefore, the eQTLs in such CREs are missed using the 1 Mb threshold. In\naddition, the 1 Mb threshold implicitly assumes that the majority of genomic regions within the\ndistance to a TSS are CREs that regulate the gene. However, we found that on average CREs\naccount for only 2.1% of the ±1Mb regions around a TSS. Moreover, it is not uncommon that\nCREs skip the closest genes to regulate distal genes. These observations indicate that many\ncandidate variants within the 1 Mb distance may be noise, and thus impede the detection of\nbona fide eQTLs. In line with this, we found that using distance thresholds smaller than 1 Mb\nsubstantially increase the numbers of eQTLs and associated genes. These results together\nindicate that the current eQTLs detection can be improved by focusing only on the CREs of\ngenes. To this end, we will use the genome structure data from 4D Nucleome and other public\ndata to build CRE-gene linkages. These linkages are expected to detect more eQTLs,\nespecially the weak ones. The results will enhance the existing GTEx dataset and substantially\nimprove our understanding of gene expression regulation and human diseases.",

      "abstract_text": "Glycan Utilization Profiling in Human Gut Microbiomes of Common Funds Data\nHealthy diets are key to prevent various metabolic diseases (e.g., cardiovascular disease, intestinal bowel\ndisease, and obesity). The western diets are known to be unhealthy as it lacks sufficient dietary fibers, which\nare critical to nurture a healthy gut microbiome. Furthermore, not only the amount but also the types of dietary\nfibers have a significant impact on the healthy gut microbiome. Personalized dietary intervention, by giving\ndifferent dietary fibers as prebiotics to different individuals, is an effective strategy to enable personalized\nnutrition for disease prevention. However, microbiome-based personalized nutrition demands a better\nunderstanding and a capability to computationally profiling glycan utilization in gut microbiomes of any human\nindividuals from different populations, lifestyles, and diseases.\nTo fill this research gap, this R03 project aims to develop a bioinformatics workflow to automatically retrieve\nCAZyme (carbohydrate active enzyme) gene clusters (CGCs) from publicly available human gut\nmetagenomes. These include microbiome data generated in three NIH Common Fund programs: the\nHuman Microbiome Project (HMP), the Integrated Human Microbiome Project (iHMP), and the Human Heredity\nand Health in Africa (H3Africa) project. Other microbiome data that were not funded by NIH will also be\nincluded to have a better representation of more diverse human populations. The genomes from HMP,\nH3Africa, and other microbiome projects will be used to identify fiber degrading CAZymes and CGCs, forming\ntwo reference databases (refCAZymes and refCGCs) that can be used to map sequencing reads from any\nindividual’s microbiome sample to infer personalized fiber utilization. To demonstrate this utility, metagenomic\nand metatranscriptomic reads of 791 samples of iHMP Inflammatory Bowel Disease Multiomics database\n(iHMP-IBDMDB) will be mapped to refCAZymes and refCGCs to compare the glycan utilization abundance and\nprevalence between IBD patients and healthy people.\nThe significance of this project is that it will contribute to a better understanding of the diversified glycan\nutilization among different human populations, lifestyles, and disease status. The workflow developed in this\nproject will be implemented as a new software package named GLUP (glycan utilization profiling, code and\ndocumentation will be on GitHub) using the popular workflow manager Nextflow to facilitate the emerging\nmicrobiome-based personalized nutrition and health industry. The innovation is that it will be the first global\nCGC-based glycan profiling across different human populations, especially in the under-represented and only\nrecently available African microbiomes. This project is built upon our highly cited CAZyme bioinformatics tool\nsuite named dbCAN that has been continuously developed since 2012.",

      "abstract_text": "Project Summary\nThis project will develop novel computational methods to leverage diverse sources of data sets, including the\nrich information generated from the NIH Common Fund projects, for drug repurposing, which may dramatically\nlower the risk of drug development by skipping early-stage trials, shorten time investment, and cut down capital\ninvestment. With the advancement of high-throughput sequencing and massively parallel technologies, more\nand more omics data are available for biomedical research. These genomics, transcriptomics, proteomics,\nmetabolomics and microbiomics data can help biomedical researchers better understand the complex\nbiological systems underlying human diseases from different perspectives. For example, genome-wide\nassociation and sequencing studies have successfully identified tens of thousands of variants that are\nsignificantly associated with one or more complex traits. Despite these great successes, the results have not\nbeen fully translated into potential clinical value. The overall goal of this pilot project is to leverage the rich\ninformation generated from the NIH Common Funds projects, in combination of other public data sets, to\nexplore the feasibility of drug repurposing through novel computational approaches. The ultimate goal of our\nproject is to develop, implement, and apply a computational framework to integrate data from the Common\nFund projects and other resources to identify potential uses of existing drugs for new indications, and we will\nalso make our newly developed tools available to the general research community. This will be accomplished\nthrough: [1] further development of a powerful framework proposed by our group to leverage cross-tissue\ninformation in the GTEx data to achieve higher accuracy in imputation of gene expression within each tissue\nand combine single-tissue association tests to derive a powerful test for gene-trait association using summary\nstatistics from genome wide association studies; [2] development of a signature-matching-based drug\nrepurposing framework with gene expression data from diverse sources (drug perturbation experiments, case\ncontrol studies, and patient intervention studies) and GWAS summary statistics; and [3] implementation and\napplication of the proposed framework to discover candidate drugs for repurposing to diseases in critical need\nof drug development, e.g. non-alcoholic steatohepatitis. With the completion of the pilot project, we will be able\nto assess the feasibility of the proposed framework for drug repurposing for further developments and\nimplementations.",

      "abstract_text": "Cancer remains the leading cause of death by disease past infancy among children in the United States. In\ncontrast to adult cancer with many genetic mutations, most pediatric cancers have few genetic mutations. Instead,\nrecent studies have shown that fusion RNAs and their encoded proteins may drive tumorigenesis in children.\nFusion RNAs are generated by exons from two genes. With the launch of the Fusion Oncoproteins in Childhood\nCancers Consortium, more fusion proteins are being found and studied. However, a complete understanding of\nthe mechanisms in pediatric cancer remains elusive, mainly due to three unsolved challenges. First, current\nstudies have focused on mRNA-derived fusion proteins and have not explored long noncoding RNA-derived\nfusion transcripts (lnc-fusions) and their encoded proteins in pediatric cancer; although lnc-fusions have been\nreported in adult cancer to regulate anti-tumor immunity. long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) are long transcripts\nof at least 200 nucleotides that cannot encode protein. lncRNAs largely outnumber mRNAs and play critical roles\nin various cancers. Therefore, a complete investigation of mechanisms driving pediatric cancer is not possible\nwithout expanding the study of fusion proteins to include lncRNA-fusions. Second, existing lnc-fusion detection\nmethods cannot explore lnc-fusions that are derived from novel lncRNAs. Due to high disease-specificity, most\nlncRNAs have not been annotated in pediatric cancer. Third, fusion RNAs, including lnc-fusions, may be formed\nby alternative mechanisms, such as chromosome rearrangement or aberrant splicing events. These alternative\nmechanisms complicate the understanding of genetic mechanisms and thus treatment.\n The large amount of multi-omics data from various Common Fund sources enables us to address these\nchallenges in pediatric cancer. Previously, we had developed computational methods to identify and characterize\nlncRNAs for human diseases and development. To discover molecular drivers in pediatric cancer, we will extend\nour previous studies of lncRNAs to identify lnc-fusions from RNA sequencing data (Aim 1). We will further\ndetermine the potential functions and formation mechanisms of lnc-fusions using integrative methods (Aim 2).\nMachine learning algorithms will be used to identify lnc-fusions as putative biomarkers and prognostic biomarkers\nin pediatric cancers.\n This study will focus on neuroblastoma and myeloid malignancies since these pediatric cancers have\nlarge cohorts of RNA sequencing and whole-genome sequencing data in the Gabriella Miller Kids First Dataset.\n In summary, we will discover lnc-fusions in pediatric cancers, develop computational methods and\nframeworks broadly applicable to existing and future RNA sequencing datasets. This study will improve the utility\nof three selected Common Fund datasets (Kids First, GTEx and 4DNucleome), and two external databases\n(GEO and TCGA).",

      "abstract_text": "ABSTRACT\nThe NIH Common Fund program has generated a number of transformative data sets containing a wide variety\nof multi-dimensional molecular and phenotypic data from human and model organisms. We propose to\npromote the integration and widen the usage of selected Common Fund data sets (KidsFirst, GTEx, and\nLINCS L1000) using UCSC Xena. UCSC Xena is a web-based high-performance resource for functional\ngenomics data visualization with a large user base in the cancer genomics research community. Xena is\nalready a visualization resource for a Common Fund data set, the GTEx transcriptome, which cancer\nresearchers can use to compare gene expression between tumors and matched normal tissues. Our proposed\nwork will further widen the usage of the Common Fund data sets by providing the scientific community a\nweb-based interactive avenue to visualize and explore the data. We also propose to integrate the data with\nother cancer genomics data for pan-cancer across-tissue comparison to identify target genes and pathways in\npatients tumors. Lastly our proposal will extend Xena Browser software functionality to use differential gene\nexpression and leverage external tools and APIs to search for small molecules that might inhibit tumor growth.\nWe propose the following aims. Aim 1. We will add KidsFirst data to Xena and integrate it with the cancer\ngenomics data already on Xena to enable comparative visualization of molecular profiles across pediatric and\nadult tumors. Aim 2. Building upon the success of the UCSC RNA-seq compendium, we will deliver an even\nlarger uniformly analyzed RNA-seq data compendium of over 25,0000 samples from KidsFirst, GTEx, TCGA,\nTARGET, CCLE and other studies. We will openly-share the compendium data using the Xena Browser. This\nrich data resource will support not only users wishing to compare expression across tumor to normal tissues,\nbut will also support the Treehouse Childhood Cancer initiative in their quest to find treatments for children with\ncancer. Aim 3. We will extend Xena software functionality to perform genome-wide differential gene\nexpression analysis and connect the analysis results to L1000FWD, a state-of-the-art web-based search and\nvisualization tool for tens of thousands of small-molecule perturbation signatures profiled by the LINCS L1000\nassay. This new feature and connectivity will enable users to predict candidate small molecule perturbations\nthat might disrupt tumor growth using the reverse tumor gene expression signature they identified on Xena.",
