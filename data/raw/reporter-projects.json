Our primary goal is to create a\nuser-friendly environment where researchers can import their data, analyze their data alongside\nother Common Fund datasets, and use a variety of analysis tools and workflows. Our Cloud\nWorkspace Implementation Center (CWIC) leverages the existing partnerships between the\nTexas Advanced Computing Center’s (TACC) unparalleled public high-performance resources,\nGalaxy’s open-source online interface for analyzing data and authoring workflows, and\nCloudBank’s tools that simplify cloud resource access and billing. By leveraging our existing\nresources and skills, this CWIC can streamline implementation of the Cloud Workspace.\nThis Cloud Workspace will provide users with access to Common Fund datasets, allow users to\nimport data from other sources, and allow for data integration and analysis. Users will have\naccess to a wide range of tools, workflows, and pipelines developed by the CFDE, by Galaxy,\nand by other partners. In addition, users will have the flexibility to use custom or third-party\ntools within the workspace. The CWIC will cater to the needs of both novice and expert users by\noffering outreach, training, and support designed to meet the diverse needs of its users. This\neffort will include user manuals, online tutorials, and tools to help users manage computing\ncosts across public and commercial computing resources. Current scientific discoveries can be\nexpensive, relying on large datasets and intensive computational processing power. Notably,\nthis Cloud Workspace will enable science across a broad set of researchers, providing access\nto large amounts of storage and compute at no cost to new users and trainees.\nBy promoting data sharing, collaboration, and ease of access, the CWIC will speed up\nbiomedical research and address high-priority challenges for our nation. The CFDE Cloud\nWorkspace represents a significant step towards realizing the vision of broadening the\ncommunity of scientists with the power to tackle complex research questions and drive\ninnovation.",

Science progresses through the accumulation of knowledge,\nwhich achieves a wide reach only if it is accessible to a diverse spectrum of researchers. While\ncomputer scientists have made substantial strides in modeling knowledge within “knowledge\ngraphs” (KGs), non-computational scientists can find it hard to interpret the graph-based\nreasoning tools and visualizations that accompany KGs because such tools use logical\nreasoning that does not account for scientific context or uncertainty and can produce a plethora\nof scientifically invalid inferences.\nOur CFDE KC will aim to present scientifically valid knowledge produced by CF projects. We will\nrepresent this knowledge as a KG, compliant with existing CFDE and external knowledge\ncuration efforts. But we will focus on scientific validity through both (a) careful knowledge\nextraction, by ensuring that each edge in the KG is either a primary experimental finding or the\nresult of an expert-applied analysis, and (b) careful knowledge presentation, by building a portal\nthat de-emphasizes general-purpose graph traversal in favor of single-purpose visualizations.\nTo implement this KC, we will draw from our experience managing four large-scale NIH-funded\nprojects that have faced similar challenges in related settings. First, our work on Terra provides\na foundation for securely storing biomedical data and making it available through cloud-based\nworkspaces. Second, our work on the Common Metabolic Diseases Knowledge Portal provides\na means to distill data into knowledge through expert-designed analyses that produce “summary\nrepresentations”, which are then presented through simple visualizations or multi-step\nprescriptive workflows. Third, our work on the A2FKP provides experience tailoring knowledge\nextraction and presentation to a variety of communities with different cultures and preferences.\nFinally, our work on the Biomedical Translator provides experience developing and complying\nwith standards for knowledge representation and exchange.\nIn specific aim 1, we will coordinate working groups of CFDE and external investigators to\nreview the knowledge across CF projects and propose how to extract and represent it within the\nKC. In specific aim 2, we will work with CF DCCs to define summary representations of their\ndata, provide them with software to make these summary representations available to us, and\nregularly “pull” and integrate these summaries within a KG compliant with Translator standards.\nIn specific aim 3, we will use the software UI/UX and search infrastructure developed for the\nCMDKP and A2FKP to build a knowledge portal that enables a diverse spectrum of scientists to\nvisualize and search CF data. In specific aim 4, we will combine our and the CF DCC’s prior\neducation and outreach strategies to publicize the portal and educate people in its use. Finally,\nin specific aim 5, we will interface with other CFDE centers to build a combined Resource Portal\nand form partnerships with external resources to amplify the reach of our KC.\nTogether, these aims will produce a CFDE KC that will unlock the full potential of CF resources\nthrough an emphasis on scientific validity, enabling scientists of all levels of expertise to\nunderstand, trust, and build upon them.",

      "abstract_text": "Abstract\nMaking NIH Common Fund (CF) datasets FAIR is but the first step in realizing their potential\nwithin the “big data” revolution. Science progresses through the accumulation of knowledge,\nwhich achieves a wide reach only if it is accessible to a diverse spectrum of researchers. While\ncomputer scientists have made substantial strides in modeling knowledge within “knowledge\ngraphs” (KGs), non-computational scientists can find it hard to interpret the graph-based\nreasoning tools and visualizations that accompany KGs because such tools use logical\nreasoning that does not account for scientific context or uncertainty and can produce a plethora\nof scientifically invalid inferences.\nOur CFDE KC will aim to present scientifically valid knowledge produced by CF projects. We will\nrepresent this knowledge as a KG, compliant with existing CFDE and external knowledge\ncuration efforts. But we will focus on scientific validity through both (a) careful knowledge\nextraction, by ensuring that each edge in the KG is either a primary experimental finding or the\nresult of an expert-applied analysis, and (b) careful knowledge presentation, by building a portal\nthat de-emphasizes general-purpose graph traversal in favor of single-purpose visualizations.\nTo implement this KC, we will draw from our experience managing four large-scale NIH-funded\nprojects that have faced similar challenges in related settings. First, our work on Terra provides\na foundation for securely storing biomedical data and making it available through cloud-based\nworkspaces. Second, our work on the Common Metabolic Diseases Knowledge Portal provides\na means to distill data into knowledge through expert-designed analyses that produce “summary\nrepresentations”, which are then presented through simple visualizations or multi-step\nprescriptive workflows. Third, our work on the A2FKP provides experience tailoring knowledge\nextraction and presentation to a variety of communities with different cultures and preferences.\nFinally, our work on the Biomedical Translator provides experience developing and complying\nwith standards for knowledge representation and exchange.\nIn specific aim 1, we will coordinate working groups of CFDE and external investigators to\nreview the knowledge across CF projects and propose how to extract and represent it within the\nKC. In specific aim 2, we will work with CF DCCs to define summary representations of their\ndata, provide them with software to make these summary representations available to us, and\nregularly “pull” and integrate these summaries within a KG compliant with Translator standards.\nIn specific aim 3, we will use the software UI/UX and search infrastructure developed for the\nCMDKP and A2FKP to build a knowledge portal that enables a diverse spectrum of scientists to\nvisualize and search CF data. In specific aim 4, we will combine our and the CF DCC’s prior\neducation and outreach strategies to publicize the portal and educate people in its use. Finally,\nin specific aim 5, we will interface with other CFDE centers to build a combined Resource Portal\nand form partnerships with external resources to amplify the reach of our KC.\nTogether, these aims will produce a CFDE KC that will unlock the full potential of CF resources\nthrough an emphasis on scientific validity, enabling scientists of all levels of expertise to\nunderstand, trust, and build upon them.",

      "abstract_text": "Abstract\nThe NIH Common Fund (CF) programs have produced transformative datasets, databases,\nmethods, bioinformatics tools and workflows that are significantly advancing biomedical research\nin the United States and worldwide. Currently, CF programs are mostly isolated. However,\nintegrating data from across CF programs has the potential for synergistic discoveries. In addition,\nsince CF programs have a time limit of 10 years, sustainability of the widely used CF digital\nresources after the programs expire is critical. To address these challenges, the NIH established\nthe Common Fund Data Ecosystem (CFDE) program which has been recently approved to\ncontinue to its second new phase. For the second phase of the CFDE, this project will establish\nthe Data Resource Center (DRC) and the Knowledge Center (KC). Our efforts will culminate in\nproducing The CFDE Workbench which will be composed of three main products: the CFDE\ninformation portal, the CFDE data resource portal, and the CFDE knowledge portal. These three\nweb portals will be full-stack web-based applications with a backend database and will be\nintegrated into one public site.\nThe CFDE information portal will be the entry point to the other two portals. It will contain\ninformation about the CFDE in a dedicated About page, information about each participating and\nnon-participating CF program, information about each data coordination center (DCC), a link to a\ncatalog of CF datasets, and a link to a catalog of CF tools and workflows, news, events, funding\nopportunities, standards and protocols, educational programs and opportunities, social media\nfeeds, and publications.\nThe CFDE data resource portal will contain metadata, data, workflows, and tools which are the\nproducts of the CF programs, and their data coordination centers (DDCs). We will adopt the C2M2\ndata model for storing information about metadata describing DCC datasets. We will also archive\nrelatively small omics datasets that do not have a home in widely established repositories and do\nnot require PHI protection. In addition, we will expand the cataloging to CF tools, APIs, and\nworkflows. Importantly, we will develop a search engine that will index and present results from\nall these assembled digital assets. In addition, continuing the work established in the CFDE pilot\nphase, users of the data portal will be able to fetch identified datasets through links provided by\nthe DCCs via the DRS protocol. This will include links to raw and processed data.\nThe CFDE knowledge portal will provide access to CF programs processed data in various\nformats including: 1) knowledge graph assertions; 2) gene, drug, metabolite, and other set\nlibraries; 3) data matrices ready for machine learning and other AI applications; 4) signatures; and\n5) bipartite graphs. In addition, the extract, transform, and load (ETL) scripts to process the data\ninto these formats will be provided. Since such processed data is relatively small, we will archive\nand serve this processed data, mint it with unique IDs, and serve it via APIs. In addition, we will\ndevelop workflows that will demonstrate how the processed data can be harmonized. At the same\ntime, we will document APIs from all CF DCCs and provide example Jupyter Notebooks that\ndemonstrate how these datasets can be accessed, processed, and combined for integrative\nomics analysis. For the knowledge portal we will also develop a library of tools that utilize these\nprocessed datasets. These tools will have some uniform requirements enabling a plug-and-play\narchitecture.\nTo achieve these goals, we will work collaboratively with the other CFDE newly established\ncenters, the participating CFDE DCCs, the CFDE NIH team, and relevant external entities and\npotential consumers of these three software products. These interactions will be achieved via\nface-to-face meetings, virtual working groups meeting, one-on-one meetings, Slack, GitHub,\nproject management software, and e-mail exchange. Via these interactions, we will establish\nstandards, workstreams, feedback and mini projects towards accomplishing the goal of\ndeveloping a lively and productive Common Fund Data Ecosystem.",

      "abstract_text": "Abstract\nThe NIH Common Fund (CF) programs have produced transformative datasets, databases,\nmethods, bioinformatics tools and workflows that are significantly advancing biomedical research\nin the United States and worldwide. Currently, CF programs are mostly isolated. However,\nintegrating data from across CF programs has the potential for synergistic discoveries. In addition,\nsince CF programs have a time limit of 10 years, sustainability of the widely used CF digital\nresources after the programs expire is critical. To address these challenges, the NIH established\nthe Common Fund Data Ecosystem (CFDE) program which has been recently approved to\ncontinue to its second new phase. For the second phase of the CFDE, this project will establish\nthe Data Resource Center (DRC) and the Knowledge Center (KC). Our efforts will culminate in\nproducing The CFDE Workbench which will be composed of three main products: the CFDE\ninformation portal, the CFDE data resource portal, and the CFDE knowledge portal. These three\nweb portals will be full-stack web-based applications with a backend database and will be\nintegrated into one public site.\nThe CFDE information portal will be the entry point to the other two portals. It will contain\ninformation about the CFDE in a dedicated About page, information about each participating and\nnon-participating CF program, information about each data coordination center (DCC), a link to a\ncatalog of CF datasets, and a link to a catalog of CF tools and workflows, news, events, funding\nopportunities, standards and protocols, educational programs and opportunities, social media\nfeeds, and publications.\nThe CFDE data resource portal will contain metadata, data, workflows, and tools which are the\nproducts of the CF programs, and their data coordination centers (DDCs). We will adopt the C2M2\ndata model for storing information about metadata describing DCC datasets. We will also archive\nrelatively small omics datasets that do not have a home in widely established repositories and do\nnot require PHI protection. In addition, we will expand the cataloging to CF tools, APIs, and\nworkflows. Importantly, we will develop a search engine that will index and present results from\nall these assembled digital assets. In addition, continuing the work established in the CFDE pilot\nphase, users of the data portal will be able to fetch identified datasets through links provided by\nthe DCCs via the DRS protocol. This will include links to raw and processed data.\nThe CFDE knowledge portal will provide access to CF programs processed data in various\nformats including: 1) knowledge graph assertions; 2) gene, drug, metabolite, and other set\nlibraries; 3) data matrices ready for machine learning and other AI applications; 4) signatures; and\n5) bipartite graphs. In addition, the extract, transform, and load (ETL) scripts to process the data\ninto these formats will be provided. Since such processed data is relatively small, we will archive\nand serve this processed data, mint it with unique IDs, and serve it via APIs. In addition, we will\ndevelop workflows that will demonstrate how the processed data can be harmonized. At the same\ntime, we will document APIs from all CF DCCs and provide example Jupyter Notebooks that\ndemonstrate how these datasets can be accessed, processed, and combined for integrative\nomics analysis. For the knowledge portal we will also develop a library of tools that utilize these\nprocessed datasets. These tools will have some uniform requirements enabling a plug-and-play\narchitecture.\nTo achieve these goals, we will work collaboratively with the other CFDE newly established\ncenters, the participating CFDE DCCs, the CFDE NIH team, and relevant external entities and\npotential consumers of these three software products. These interactions will be achieved via\nface-to-face meetings, virtual working groups meeting, one-on-one meetings, Slack, GitHub,\nproject management software, and e-mail exchange. Via these interactions, we will establish\nstandards, workstreams, feedback and mini projects towards accomplishing the goal of\ndeveloping a lively and productive Common Fund Data Ecosystem.",
