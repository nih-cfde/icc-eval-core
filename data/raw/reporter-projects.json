      "abstract_text": "Detailed Engagement Plan\nThe National Institutes of Health Common Fund’s Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx) project was\nlaunched in 2010 with a goal of providing the scientific community with a resource for the study of human\ngene expression and regulation across multiple tissues, to specifically provide insights into the mechanisms\nof gene regulation and disease-related perturbations, and to further our understanding of the role that\ninherited genetic variation plays in susceptibility to complex diseases. The project enrolled 960 recently\ndeceased, adult donors and collected close to 49,000 tissue samples. Core data generation was\ncompleted at the end of 2017, with the primary data types including whole genome (WGS, 30X) and whole\nexome (WES, 100X) sequence data on all donors, and RNA-sequence data from at least 25,000 samples\nspanning 53 human tissues/organs. This dataset constitutes the largest multi-tissue RNA sequence data\nresource generated to date (a previous study of genetic effects on gene expression, TwinsUK/EUROBATS,\ngenerated ~2,700 RNA-seq samples from four accessible tissue sites). The GTEx resource also includes\na rich and well annotated collection of donor, sample, and experiment metadata. Furthermore, additional\nmolecular data types, aimed at enhancing the core data sets, are still being produced, including mass\nspectrometry-based proteomics, measurements of DNA methylation, histone marks (ChIP-seq), somatic\nDNA sequencing, and DNase I hypersensitivity sites.\nThe GTEx resource includes both protected-access and open-access data (Fig. 1). The protected-access\ndata include extensive sample, subject and technical metadata and raw sequence BAM files from RNAseq,\nwhole genome (WGS) and whole exome (WES) sequencing, ChIP-seq and m6A RNA-seq, as well as\nprotected data derived from these such as genotype calls in VCF format. An approved dbGaP application\nis required to obtain all protected-access data, including access to the raw sequence data, which are\naccessible on the AnVIL platform (on Google Cloud Platform; GCP). The GTEx data also include a large\namount of open-access data, such as gene and transcript expression quantifications, cis- and trans-expression\nand splicing QTLs, histology images of every tissue, some eGTEx data summaries, the sample\nbiobank, and a very limited set of de-identified sample and subject metadata. All of these public data are\navailable for download, and as interactive visualizations and summary tables on the GTEx portal.\nThe GTEx project has developed an extensive suite of tools and analysis pipelines that have been\nbenchmarked, optimized and implemented in GCP for the project (such as the RNA-seq alignment,\nquantification, and QC pipeline, and the QTL analysis pipeline). These pipelines were also selected by the\nTOPMed project to produce a harmonized resource of RNA sequence data across the large number of\ncohorts being sequenced for that project (>20,000 samples to date); our team was involved in initial\nbenchmarking and harmonization tests of our pipeline across TOPMed sequencing centers and are actively\ninvolved in ongoing data production and analyses. Moreover, very similar pipelines are used by the\nENCODE project, thus facilitating comparisons across large datasets that would be prohibitive in terms of\ncosts and computational resources in the absence of harmonized pipelines. We have also created\nnumerous visualizations developed specifically for the open access data on the GTEx portal. The GTEx\nproject has a very large user community: the GTEx data have the second largest number of Data Access\nRequests for protected data in dbGaP (behind TCGA), and it is the most frequently downloaded dbGaP\nproject. An even larger number of users access the data, tools and interactive visualizations on the GTEx\nportal: in the 2019 calendar year, the GTEx portal had 135,000 users (~12,000-18,000/month) worldwide,\nwith users spiking in October 2019 following the release of the V8 data. The GTEx consortium has published\nnumerous papers describing the dataset and analyses of the data, and two additional data releases are\nstill planned.",

      "abstract_text": "Detailed Engagement Plan\nThe National Institutes of Health Common Fund’s Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx) project was\nlaunched in 2010 with a goal of providing the scientific community with a resource for the study of human\ngene expression and regulation across multiple tissues, to specifically provide insights into the mechanisms\nof gene regulation and disease-related perturbations, and to further our understanding of the role that\ninherited genetic variation plays in susceptibility to complex diseases. The project enrolled 960 recently\ndeceased, adult donors and collected close to 49,000 tissue samples. Core data generation was\ncompleted at the end of 2017, with the primary data types including whole genome (WGS, 30X) and whole\nexome (WES, 100X) sequence data on all donors, and RNA-sequence data from at least 25,000 samples\nspanning 53 human tissues/organs. This dataset constitutes the largest multi-tissue RNA sequence data\nresource generated to date (a previous study of genetic effects on gene expression, TwinsUK/EUROBATS,\ngenerated ~2,700 RNA-seq samples from four accessible tissue sites). The GTEx resource also includes\na rich and well annotated collection of donor, sample, and experiment metadata. Furthermore, additional\nmolecular data types, aimed at enhancing the core data sets, are still being produced, including mass\nspectrometry-based proteomics, measurements of DNA methylation, histone marks (ChIP-seq), somatic\nDNA sequencing, and DNase I hypersensitivity sites.\nThe GTEx resource includes both protected-access and open-access data (Fig. 1). The protected-access\ndata include extensive sample, subject and technical metadata and raw sequence BAM files from RNAseq,\nwhole genome (WGS) and whole exome (WES) sequencing, ChIP-seq and m6A RNA-seq, as well as\nprotected data derived from these such as genotype calls in VCF format. An approved dbGaP application\nis required to obtain all protected-access data, including access to the raw sequence data, which are\naccessible on the AnVIL platform (on Google Cloud Platform; GCP). The GTEx data also include a large\namount of open-access data, such as gene and transcript expression quantifications, cis- and trans-expression\nand splicing QTLs, histology images of every tissue, some eGTEx data summaries, the sample\nbiobank, and a very limited set of de-identified sample and subject metadata. All of these public data are\navailable for download, and as interactive visualizations and summary tables on the GTEx portal.\nThe GTEx project has developed an extensive suite of tools and analysis pipelines that have been\nbenchmarked, optimized and implemented in GCP for the project (such as the RNA-seq alignment,\nquantification, and QC pipeline, and the QTL analysis pipeline). These pipelines were also selected by the\nTOPMed project to produce a harmonized resource of RNA sequence data across the large number of\ncohorts being sequenced for that project (>20,000 samples to date); our team was involved in initial\nbenchmarking and harmonization tests of our pipeline across TOPMed sequencing centers and are actively\ninvolved in ongoing data production and analyses. Moreover, very similar pipelines are used by the\nENCODE project, thus facilitating comparisons across large datasets that would be prohibitive in terms of\ncosts and computational resources in the absence of harmonized pipelines. We have also created\nnumerous visualizations developed specifically for the open access data on the GTEx portal. The GTEx\nproject has a very large user community: the GTEx data have the second largest number of Data Access\nRequests for protected data in dbGaP (behind TCGA), and it is the most frequently downloaded dbGaP\nproject. An even larger number of users access the data, tools and interactive visualizations on the GTEx\nportal: in the 2019 calendar year, the GTEx portal had 135,000 users (~12,000-18,000/month) worldwide,\nwith users spiking in October 2019 following the release of the V8 data. The GTEx consortium has published\nnumerous papers describing the dataset and analyses of the data, and two additional data releases are\nstill planned.",

      "abstract_text": "Detailed Engagement Plan\nThe National Institutes of Health Common Fund’s Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx) project was\nlaunched in 2010 with a goal of providing the scientific community with a resource for the study of human\ngene expression and regulation across multiple tissues, to specifically provide insights into the mechanisms\nof gene regulation and disease-related perturbations, and to further our understanding of the role that\ninherited genetic variation plays in susceptibility to complex diseases. The project enrolled 960 recently\ndeceased, adult donors and collected close to 49,000 tissue samples. Core data generation was\ncompleted at the end of 2017, with the primary data types including whole genome (WGS, 30X) and whole\nexome (WES, 100X) sequence data on all donors, and RNA-sequence data from at least 25,000 samples\nspanning 53 human tissues/organs. This dataset constitutes the largest multi-tissue RNA sequence data\nresource generated to date (a previous study of genetic effects on gene expression, TwinsUK/EUROBATS,\ngenerated ~2,700 RNA-seq samples from four accessible tissue sites). The GTEx resource also includes\na rich and well annotated collection of donor, sample, and experiment metadata. Furthermore, additional\nmolecular data types, aimed at enhancing the core data sets, are still being produced, including mass\nspectrometry-based proteomics, measurements of DNA methylation, histone marks (ChIP-seq), somatic\nDNA sequencing, and DNase I hypersensitivity sites.\nThe GTEx resource includes both protected-access and open-access data (Fig. 1). The protected-access\ndata include extensive sample, subject and technical metadata and raw sequence BAM files from RNAseq,\nwhole genome (WGS) and whole exome (WES) sequencing, ChIP-seq and m6A RNA-seq, as well as\nprotected data derived from these such as genotype calls in VCF format. An approved dbGaP application\nis required to obtain all protected-access data, including access to the raw sequence data, which are\naccessible on the AnVIL platform (on Google Cloud Platform; GCP). The GTEx data also include a large\namount of open-access data, such as gene and transcript expression quantifications, cis- and trans-expression\nand splicing QTLs, histology images of every tissue, some eGTEx data summaries, the sample\nbiobank, and a very limited set of de-identified sample and subject metadata. All of these public data are\navailable for download, and as interactive visualizations and summary tables on the GTEx portal.\nThe GTEx project has developed an extensive suite of tools and analysis pipelines that have been\nbenchmarked, optimized and implemented in GCP for the project (such as the RNA-seq alignment,\nquantification, and QC pipeline, and the QTL analysis pipeline). These pipelines were also selected by the\nTOPMed project to produce a harmonized resource of RNA sequence data across the large number of\ncohorts being sequenced for that project (>20,000 samples to date); our team was involved in initial\nbenchmarking and harmonization tests of our pipeline across TOPMed sequencing centers and are actively\ninvolved in ongoing data production and analyses. Moreover, very similar pipelines are used by the\nENCODE project, thus facilitating comparisons across large datasets that would be prohibitive in terms of\ncosts and computational resources in the absence of harmonized pipelines. We have also created\nnumerous visualizations developed specifically for the open access data on the GTEx portal. The GTEx\nproject has a very large user community: the GTEx data have the second largest number of Data Access\nRequests for protected data in dbGaP (behind TCGA), and it is the most frequently downloaded dbGaP\nproject. An even larger number of users access the data, tools and interactive visualizations on the GTEx\nportal: in the 2019 calendar year, the GTEx portal had 135,000 users (~12,000-18,000/month) worldwide,\nwith users spiking in October 2019 following the release of the V8 data. The GTEx consortium has published\nnumerous papers describing the dataset and analyses of the data, and two additional data releases are\nstill planned.",

Our primary goal is to create a\nuser-friendly environment where researchers can import their data, analyze their data alongside\nother Common Fund datasets, and use a variety of analysis tools and workflows. Our Cloud\nWorkspace Implementation Center (CWIC) leverages the existing partnerships between the\nTexas Advanced Computing Center’s (TACC) unparalleled public high-performance resources,\nGalaxy’s open-source online interface for analyzing data and authoring workflows, and\nCloudBank’s tools that simplify cloud resource access and billing. By leveraging our existing\nresources and skills, this CWIC can streamline implementation of the Cloud Workspace.\nThis Cloud Workspace will provide users with access to Common Fund datasets, allow users to\nimport data from other sources, and allow for data integration and analysis. Users will have\naccess to a wide range of tools, workflows, and pipelines developed by the CFDE, by Galaxy,\nand by other partners. In addition, users will have the flexibility to use custom or third-party\ntools within the workspace. The CWIC will cater to the needs of both novice and expert users by\noffering outreach, training, and support designed to meet the diverse needs of its users. This\neffort will include user manuals, online tutorials, and tools to help users manage computing\ncosts across public and commercial computing resources. Current scientific discoveries can be\nexpensive, relying on large datasets and intensive computational processing power. Notably,\nthis Cloud Workspace will enable science across a broad set of researchers, providing access\nto large amounts of storage and compute at no cost to new users and trainees.\nBy promoting data sharing, collaboration, and ease of access, the CWIC will speed up\nbiomedical research and address high-priority challenges for our nation. The CFDE Cloud\nWorkspace represents a significant step towards realizing the vision of broadening the\ncommunity of scientists with the power to tackle complex research questions and drive\ninnovation.",

Within the\nIDG, the Knowledge Management Center (IDG-KMC) integrates data from a wide range of chemical, biological\nand clinical resources, and has developed platforms that can be used to navigate understudied proteins (the\n“dark genome”), and their potential contribution to specific pathologies.

The IDG KMC designs, develops, implements, and updates the Target Central Repository Database\n(TCRD), a protein knowledgebase. The IDG KMC also expands, improves, and maintains Pharos, the TCRD\nportal, with support for automated data summaries, and active community feedback. Both TCRD and Pharos\nalready integrate data from three Common Fund projects: GTEx, IMPC/KOMP and LINCS.

The IDG-KMC has information from\nempirical evidence and from computational predictions about the function of these genes, which are commonly\nunder-studied. Hence, data from the IDG-KMC can enrich the CFDE users who examine datasets that list genes\nand proteins. Several IDG resources provide gene landing pages that provide unique information about genes.\nThese landing pages can be improved regarding FAIRness and can become a resource for the CFDE.

Within the\nIDG, the Knowledge Management Center (IDG-KMC) integrates data from a wide range of chemical, biological\nand clinical resources, and has developed platforms that can be used to navigate understudied proteins (the\n“dark genome”), and their potential contribution to specific pathologies. Specifically, the IDG KMC is creating\nautomated workflows to capture relevant public data for the entire proteome including manual annotations for\nthe IDG list, covering five major areas: genotype, phenotype, expression, structure & function, and interactions\n& pathways. The IDG KMC designs, develops, implements, and updates the Target Central Repository Database\n(TCRD), a protein knowledgebase. The IDG KMC also expands, improves, and maintains Pharos, the TCRD\nportal, with support for automated data summaries, and active community feedback. Both TCRD and Pharos\nalready integrate data from three Common Fund projects: GTEx, IMPC/KOMP and LINCS. The IDG KMC\nconsolidates all the data generated by the Data and Resource Generation Centers (DRGCs), improving these\ndata findability, accessibility, interoperability, reusability (FAIRness) and serving these data on the Pharos portal.\nThe IDG program interface with the CFDE will enable hypothesis generation about novel drug targets for complex\ndiseases. Many other Common Fund (CF) programs produce data about genetic variants and differentially\nexpressed genes and proteins in the context of many complex human diseases. These genes in many cases do\nnot have much information about them. For example, the CF program Undiagnosed Disease Network (UDN)\nidentifies mutations in genes associated with undiagnosed diseases. The IDG-KMC has information from\nempirical evidence and from computational predictions about the function of these genes, which are commonly\nunder-studied. Hence, data from the IDG-KMC can enrich the CFDE users who examine datasets that list genes\nand proteins. Several IDG resources provide gene landing pages that provide unique information about genes.\nThese landing pages can be improved regarding FAIRness and can become a resource for the CFDE. In\naddition, data collected by the DRGCs and by the R03 IDG awardees can enrich the content of the CFDE portal. In\nparticular, results from the R03 projects (Fig. 1) are currently not evaluated or stored in one place and are at risk\nof becoming lost.

      "abstract_text": "Driving scientific questions that will be addressed by engaging with the CFDE and why it has not\nyet been feasible\nThe Library of Integrated Network-based Cellular Signatures (LINCS) program (1) collected massive data\nfrom human cells perturbed by thousands of single small molecules as well as knockouts, knockdowns,\nand over-expression of single genes. The diverse collections of perturbed human cells (n>50) were profiled\nbefore and after the perturbations with an array of omics assays that include transcriptomics, proteomics,\nepigenomics, cell viability, and imaging at different time points and where the small molecules were applied\nin different concentrations. Altogether, over 2 million signatures are expected to be produced and provided\nas a resource for the community for query and reuse at the time when the LINCS program officially ends\n(6/2020). Such a resource can be used for limitless applications, for example, to study molecular\nmechanisms of disease, repurpose existing drugs, predict side effects and indications for pre-clinical small\nmolecules, associate small molecules with the targets that they likely affect directly and indirectly,\nreconstruct cell signaling and gene regulatory networks, understand the global space of all possible cellular\nstates in response to all possible perturbations of all human cells, and many more applications and use\ncases. This utilization of LINCS resources is already happening but can be significantly enhanced via\ncontinued efforts led by the LINCS Data Coordination and Integration Center (DCIC) through interactions\nwith the CFDE and other CF DCCs in the next 3 years.\nSo far, the ~400 publications produced by the LINCS consortium have been cited by ~6,000 other papers,\ndemonstrating the high impact of the program on the research community. In particular, the computational\nresources developed by the LINCS DCIC have been very successful. These tools and databases were\nalready visited by >1 million unique users, with currently ~30,000 unique users per month (based on Google\nAnalytics). These strong usage statistics demonstrate the value of LINCS resources and their potential for\nmaking long-lasting impact on drug discovery, and the biomedical research community in general. The\nLINCS DCIC developed web-based resources to enable the federated access, intuitive querying, and\nintegrative analysis and visualization of the LINCS data combined with other relevant data. To achieve this\nthe LINCS DCIC also processed many additional external data types from other relevant resources to be\nintegrated with LINCS data including data from other Common Fund programs such as GTEx, Epigenomics\nRoadmap, and IMPC.

The diverse collections of perturbed human cells (n>50) were profiled\nbefore and after the perturbations with an array of omics assays that include transcriptomics, proteomics,\nepigenomics, cell viability, and imaging at different time points and where the small molecules were applied\nin different concentrations. Altogether, over 2 million signatures are expected to be produced and provided\nas a resource for the community for query and reuse at the time when the LINCS program officially ends\n(6/2020). Such a resource can be used for limitless applications, for example, to study molecular\nmechanisms of disease, repurpose existing drugs, predict side effects and indications for pre-clinical small\nmolecules, associate small molecules with the targets that they likely affect directly and indirectly,\nreconstruct cell signaling and gene regulatory networks, understand the global space of all possible cellular\nstates in response to all possible perturbations of all human cells, and many more applications and use\ncases. This utilization of LINCS resources is already happening but can be significantly enhanced via\ncontinued efforts led by the LINCS Data Coordination and Integration Center (DCIC) through interactions\nwith the CFDE and other CF DCCs in the next 3 years.\nSo far, the ~400 publications produced by the LINCS consortium have been cited by ~6,000 other papers,\ndemonstrating the high impact of the program on the research community. In particular, the computational\nresources developed by the LINCS DCIC have been very successful. These tools and databases were\nalready visited by >1 million unique users, with currently ~30,000 unique users per month (based on Google\nAnalytics). These strong usage statistics demonstrate the value of LINCS resources and their potential for\nmaking long-lasting impact on drug discovery, and the biomedical research community in general. The\nLINCS DCIC developed web-based resources to enable the federated access, intuitive querying, and\nintegrative analysis and visualization of the LINCS data combined with other relevant data. To achieve this\nthe LINCS DCIC also processed many additional external data types from other relevant resources to be\nintegrated with LINCS data including data from other Common Fund programs such as GTEx, Epigenomics\nRoadmap, and IMPC.

      "abstract_text": "Driving scientific questions that will be addressed by engaging with the CFDE and why it has not\nyet been feasible\nThe Library of Integrated Network-based Cellular Signatures (LINCS) program (1) collected massive data\nfrom human cells perturbed by thousands of single small molecules as well as knockouts, knockdowns,\nand over-expression of single genes. The diverse collections of perturbed human cells (n>50) were profiled\nbefore and after the perturbations with an array of omics assays that include transcriptomics, proteomics,\nepigenomics, cell viability, and imaging at different time points and where the small molecules were applied\nin different concentrations. Altogether, over 2 million signatures are expected to be produced and provided\nas a resource for the community for query and reuse at the time when the LINCS program officially ends\n(6/2020). Such a resource can be used for limitless applications, for example, to study molecular\nmechanisms of disease, repurpose existing drugs, predict side effects and indications for pre-clinical small\nmolecules, associate small molecules with the targets that they likely affect directly and indirectly,\nreconstruct cell signaling and gene regulatory networks, understand the global space of all possible cellular\nstates in response to all possible perturbations of all human cells, and many more applications and use\ncases. This utilization of LINCS resources is already happening but can be significantly enhanced via\ncontinued efforts led by the LINCS Data Coordination and Integration Center (DCIC) through interactions\nwith the CFDE and other CF DCCs in the next 3 years.\nSo far, the ~400 publications produced by the LINCS consortium have been cited by ~6,000 other papers,\ndemonstrating the high impact of the program on the research community. In particular, the computational\nresources developed by the LINCS DCIC have been very successful. These tools and databases were\nalready visited by >1 million unique users, with currently ~30,000 unique users per month (based on Google\nAnalytics). These strong usage statistics demonstrate the value of LINCS resources and their potential for\nmaking long-lasting impact on drug discovery, and the biomedical research community in general. The\nLINCS DCIC developed web-based resources to enable the federated access, intuitive querying, and\nintegrative analysis and visualization of the LINCS data combined with other relevant data. To achieve this\nthe LINCS DCIC also processed many additional external data types from other relevant resources to be\nintegrated with LINCS data including data from other Common Fund programs such as GTEx, Epigenomics\nRoadmap, and IMPC. However, such data integration efforts were achieved with little consideration of\ncommunity standards to ensure their long term findability, accessibility, interoperability and reusability\n(FAIR) (2). Our involvement with the NIH Data Commons Pilot Project Consortium (DCPPC) and the\nCommon Fund Data Ecosystem (CFDE) taught us many lessons on how to better achieve data\nharmonization via the adoption of community standards to achieve long term sustainability of LINCS\nresources. Hence, by interacting with the CFDE, adhering to the requirements that the CFDE will establish,\nwe will be able to reprocess the LINCS data, and the other data we use to integrate with LINCS, with\ntransformations that will enable improved FAIRness, further enabling more complex use cases.\nIn addition, by interacting directly with other CF DCCs we will enable the direct integration of LINCS data\nwith other CF generated resources. Our plan is to develop an interactive web-based data visualization\ncomponent that will enable users to project RNA-seq samples (patients, single cells, or signatures) into a\nlower dimensional space based on their transcriptomics data profiling. Such visualization will be linked to\nthe metadata describing each sample, as well as automatically identified clusters, enrichment analysis\nresults for each sample or cluster, and predictions of drugs and small molecules from the LINCS resource.\nThis interactive web-based data visualization component will enable, for example, assisting KidsFirst portal\nusers, including physicians, to prescribe the most appropriate therapeutics to the right subtype of patients,\nas well as trace patients over time to monitor their response to treatment enable decision support for\nchanging treatment course early, if necessary.\nFinally, by moving all LINCS resources into a cloud environment through STRIDES, we will ensure that\nLINCS resources are archived for the long term ensuring maximal reuse and enabling applications that are\ncurrently not even imagined or possible.",

      "abstract_text": "Driving scientific questions that will be addressed by engaging with the CFDE and why it has not\nyet been feasible\nThe Library of Integrated Network-based Cellular Signatures (LINCS) program (1) collected massive data\nfrom human cells perturbed by thousands of single small molecules as well as knockouts, knockdowns,\nand over-expression of single genes. The diverse collections of perturbed human cells (n>50) were profiled\nbefore and after the perturbations with an array of omics assays that include transcriptomics, proteomics,\nepigenomics, cell viability, and imaging at different time points and where the small molecules were applied\nin different concentrations. Altogether, over 2 million signatures are expected to be produced and provided\nas a resource for the community for query and reuse at the time when the LINCS program officially ends\n(6/2020). Such a resource can be used for limitless applications, for example, to study molecular\nmechanisms of disease, repurpose existing drugs, predict side effects and indications for pre-clinical small\nmolecules, associate small molecules with the targets that they likely affect directly and indirectly,\nreconstruct cell signaling and gene regulatory networks, understand the global space of all possible cellular\nstates in response to all possible perturbations of all human cells, and many more applications and use\ncases. This utilization of LINCS resources is already happening but can be significantly enhanced via\ncontinued efforts led by the LINCS Data Coordination and Integration Center (DCIC) through interactions\nwith the CFDE and other CF DCCs in the next 3 years.\nSo far, the ~400 publications produced by the LINCS consortium have been cited by ~6,000 other papers,\ndemonstrating the high impact of the program on the research community. In particular, the computational\nresources developed by the LINCS DCIC have been very successful. These tools and databases were\nalready visited by >1 million unique users, with currently ~30,000 unique users per month (based on Google\nAnalytics). These strong usage statistics demonstrate the value of LINCS resources and their potential for\nmaking long-lasting impact on drug discovery, and the biomedical research community in general. The\nLINCS DCIC developed web-based resources to enable the federated access, intuitive querying, and\nintegrative analysis and visualization of the LINCS data combined with other relevant data. To achieve this\nthe LINCS DCIC also processed many additional external data types from other relevant resources to be\nintegrated with LINCS data including data from other Common Fund programs such as GTEx, Epigenomics\nRoadmap, and IMPC. However, such data integration efforts were achieved with little consideration of\ncommunity standards to ensure their long term findability, accessibility, interoperability and reusability\n(FAIR) (2). Our involvement with the NIH Data Commons Pilot Project Consortium (DCPPC) and the\nCommon Fund Data Ecosystem (CFDE) taught us many lessons on how to better achieve data\nharmonization via the adoption of community standards to achieve long term sustainability of LINCS\nresources. Hence, by interacting with the CFDE, adhering to the requirements that the CFDE will establish,\nwe will be able to reprocess the LINCS data, and the other data we use to integrate with LINCS, with\ntransformations that will enable improved FAIRness, further enabling more complex use cases.\nIn addition, by interacting directly with other CF DCCs we will enable the direct integration of LINCS data\nwith other CF generated resources. Our plan is to develop an interactive web-based data visualization\ncomponent that will enable users to project RNA-seq samples (patients, single cells, or signatures) into a\nlower dimensional space based on their transcriptomics data profiling. Such visualization will be linked to\nthe metadata describing each sample, as well as automatically identified clusters, enrichment analysis\nresults for each sample or cluster, and predictions of drugs and small molecules from the LINCS resource.\nThis interactive web-based data visualization component will enable, for example, assisting KidsFirst portal\nusers, including physicians, to prescribe the most appropriate therapeutics to the right subtype of patients,\nas well as trace patients over time to monitor their response to treatment enable decision support for\nchanging treatment course early, if necessary.\nFinally, by moving all LINCS resources into a cloud environment through STRIDES, we will ensure that\nLINCS resources are archived for the long term ensuring maximal reuse and enabling applications that are\ncurrently not even imagined or possible.",

Metadata and asset ingestion into the data resource portal will include the production of C2M2 data submission manifests and the upload of these manifests to the CFDE Workbench including specification of ontology mappings. This will also entail maintenance of the SPARC data submission export pipeline to support updates in SPARC metadata and any updates to the CFDE submission process. As the SPARC DRC is now also supporting data publication through other initiatives (e.g. NIH HEAL) we will also work with CFDE to determine best ways to annotate these data assets that have begun to be published. Additional asset ingestion into the data resource portal will continue to include knowledge graph assertions from the SPARC Connectivity knowledge graph (SCKAN). In addition, we will pilot the contribution of assertions from the Functional Connectivity Map – which is focused on biological compartments, their connectivity, their protein and small molecule constituents, as well as related biophysical models that study related processes (e.g., fluid flow, drug transport). This FC Map currently contains knowledge for ~300 drugs and~900 related gene products, and explicitly represents knowledge about relevant tissues, cells, fluids, protein and small molecules.

This project integrates GlyGen's glycoconjugate, glycan array, and protein variation data into the NIH Common Fund Data Ecosystem (CFDE), ensuring the unique data types are interoperable, findable, accessible, and reusable. The effort directly supports the CFDE mission to enable cross-domain biomedical research and advance precision medicine. The project introduces extensions to the data model for protein site-specific variation and glycan-protein datasets. The project will also prepare data in formats that support next-gen analytical methods, including machine learning and knowledge graph development, making the resources adaptable and broadly usable. The development of documentation, reusable workflows, and training materials will enhance reproducibility, interoperability, and community adoption. The GlyGen team will perform quarterly submissions of GlyGen metadata and datasets to the portal, with persistent access maintained through resolver services. Usage statistics and feedback will be collected to monitor adoption and guide improvements. Active engagement in steering committees, working groups, and public webinars will ensure alignment with consortium priorities. The project will participate in the Ontology Working Group and implement recommendations that will enable connecting GlyGen data with other DCC data and facilitate metadata submission. The team will provide expert suggestions on RFCs, contributing to consortium standards development. Education and training efforts will be coordinated with the Training Center to enhance workforce development and increase adoption of resources.  Sustained mechanisms for access, usage monitoring, and outreach will be established. By integrating GlyGen data into CFDE, researchers will gain access to detailed maps connecting glycans, genes, proteins, and other -omics data. The integration will support unique glycan use cases, including exploring sequence variants in glyco-related genes, understanding glycan epitopes, and investigating glycosyltransferases in rare diseases. Collaboration with CFDE-DCCs will facilitate data exchange and tool sharing, enabling multi-disciplinary queries and hypothesis testing that were previously impossible, now possible through CFDE. ",

      "abstract_text": "The accessibility of information relevant for interpreting genetic variants. As the pace of WGS\naccelerates, the interpretation of the 99% of variants revealed by WGS that are non-coding is of\nincreasing importance. High-volume “omic” profiling datasets generated by Common Fund projects and\nderived information about specific variants and regulatory elements have great potential to inform the\ninterpretation of such non-coding variants. NIH CF Roadmap Epigenome, GTEx and CF Extracellular\nRNA Communication Consortium (CF ERCC) already generate publicly shareable information about the\nimpact of individual regulatory variants in the form of allele-specific DNA methylation, chromatin states,\ntranscription factor binding, phased allelic transcription, e/sQTL information, and transcription status of\nnon-coding and coding variants. More detailed information that may help evaluate functional effects of a\nvariant in specific haplotype and tissue contexts can be gleaned from privacy-protected multi-omic\nprofiles of biosamples containing the variant. Both the summary-level and the protected variant\ninformation is currently fragmented, poorly accessible and lacks interoperability.\nThe scope of this project. By\nleveraging resources from the CF ERCC\nand NHGRI ClinGen projects (Table 1),\nwe will unlock the value of variant\ninformation across Common Fund\nprojects. One immediate aim will be to\nimprove FAIRness of Extracellular RNA\nCommunication Consortium (ERCC)\ndata and make it accessible via the\nCFDE Data Portal. Additional two aims\ncut across CF projects and involve the\ndevelopment of infrastructure for\n“genomic indexing”, i.e., for aggregating\nvariant information across CF projects\nand for making the information FAIR and useful in both the research and clinical use cases. The\ninformation will be aggregated at the summary-level that does not compromise identity of participants and\nalso at the more detailed level that will be protected and will involve authorized access. We will initiate the\ncross-CF integration with variant information from Roadmap Epigenome, GTEx, and the Extracellular\nRNA Communication Consortium (ERCC) projects. In collaboration with GTEx (see letter from Dr. Kristin\nArdlie, GTEx PI), we will make the aggregated variant information accessible via web UIs and APIs\nhosted at the CFDE Data Portal.\nThe research and clinical diagnostic use cases. The research use cases will come from the NIH\nCommon Fund Gabriella Miller Kids First-KOMP2 (see letters from Dr. Bruce Gelb, KidsFirst-KOMP2 PI,\nand Dr. Sharon Plon, KidsFirst PI). The clinical diagnostic use cases will come from the NHGRI Clinical\nGenome Resource (ClinGen) project (see letter from Dr. Sharon Plon, ClinGen PI). In collaboration with\nthese projects, we will develop data models, data flows, system designs, and will participate in the\nvalidation of the systems. This collaboration between Drs. Gelb, Plon and Milosavljevic will build on\nseveral years of their previous collaboration within ClinGen where Dr. Gelb co-chairs the RASopathy\nExpert Panel and Drs. Plon and Milosavljevic serve on the ClinGen Steering Committee.\nFOA Areas addressed. As described below, our project will partner with CFDE-CC in the following two\nAreas listed in the FOA: Area 1 (Enabling access to, and computation across, multiple data sets in a\ncloud environment – addressed in this Section) and Area 3 (Enabling end-users to compute on data in the\ncloud – addressed in Section 2).",

NIH CF Roadmap Epigenome, GTEx and CF Extracellular\nRNA Communication Consortium (CF ERCC) already generate publicly shareable information about the\nimpact of individual regulatory variants in the form of allele-specific DNA methylation, chromatin states,\ntranscription factor binding, phased allelic transcription, e/sQTL information, and transcription status of\nnon-coding and coding variants. More detailed information that may help evaluate functional effects of a\nvariant in specific haplotype and tissue contexts can be gleaned from privacy-protected multi-omic\nprofiles of biosamples containing the variant. Both the summary-level and the protected variant\ninformation is currently fragmented, poorly accessible and lacks interoperability.\nThe scope of this project. By\nleveraging resources from the CF ERCC\nand NHGRI ClinGen projects (Table 1),\nwe will unlock the value of variant\ninformation across Common Fund\nprojects. One immediate aim will be to\nimprove FAIRness of Extracellular RNA\nCommunication Consortium (ERCC)\ndata and make it accessible via the\nCFDE Data Portal. Additional two aims\ncut across CF projects and involve the\ndevelopment of infrastructure for\n“genomic indexing”, i.e., for aggregating\nvariant information across CF projects\nand for making the information FAIR and useful in both the research and clinical use cases. The\ninformation will be aggregated at the summary-level that does not compromise identity of participants and\nalso at the more detailed level that will be protected and will involve authorized access. We will initiate the\ncross-CF integration with variant information from Roadmap Epigenome, GTEx, and the Extracellular\nRNA Communication Consortium (ERCC) projects. In collaboration with GTEx (see letter from Dr. Kristin\nArdlie, GTEx PI), we will make the aggregated variant information accessible via web UIs and APIs\nhosted at the CFDE Data Portal.\nThe research and clinical diagnostic use cases. The research use cases will come from the NIH\nCommon Fund Gabriella Miller Kids First-KOMP2 (see letters from Dr. Bruce Gelb, KidsFirst-KOMP2 PI,\nand Dr. Sharon Plon, KidsFirst PI). The clinical diagnostic use cases will come from the NHGRI Clinical\nGenome Resource (ClinGen) project (see letter from Dr. Sharon Plon, ClinGen PI). In collaboration with\nthese projects, we will develop data models, data flows, system designs, and will participate in the\nvalidation of the systems. This collaboration between Drs. Gelb, Plon and Milosavljevic will build on\nseveral years of their previous collaboration within ClinGen where Dr. Gelb co-chairs the RASopathy\nExpert Panel and Drs. Plon and Milosavljevic serve on the ClinGen Steering Committee.\nFOA Areas addressed. As described below, our project will partner with CFDE-CC in the following two\nAreas listed in the FOA: Area 1 (Enabling access to, and computation across, multiple data sets in a\ncloud environment – addressed in this Section) and Area 3 (Enabling end-users to compute on data in the\ncloud – addressed in Section 2).",

Our proposed\nengagements span the 3 key areas defined in the OT EOA and include GTEx, LINCS, HUBMAP, and\nSPARC as well as the activities the Kids First DRC is leading as part of the NIH Interoperability Working\nGroup to further the establishment of the Common Fund Data Ecosystem (CFDE).\nThe four investigators collaborating on this proposal have distinct professional backgrounds, areas of\nexpertise, and research tools at their disposal including leading the Kids First DCC/DRP and CAVATICA\nefforts.\nAt the Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia, Dr. Adam Resnick is a cancer and neuroscience research\nscientist with expertise in pediatric brain tumors and Dr. Allison Heath is a computer science expert in\nlarge-scale data bioinformatics and compute infrastructure. These experts will work together to lead the\nCHOP project team. At Centre Hospitalier Universitaire Sainte-Justine, Dr. Vincent Ferretti develops\nbioinformatics software for both large-scale software development and computational genomics. At Seven\nBridges, Dr. Jack DiGiovanna is an expert in cloud-based analysis platforms for bioinformatics that are\nscalable, collaborative, and reproducible.\nResponsibilities of Investigators\nAll PIs will share responsibility for ensuring the ethical conduct of the project, upholding the scientific\nintegrity of the project, administration, oversight and coordination of the project’s management.\nDr. Adam Resnick will serve as the contact PI. He will be responsible for the overall strategy, determining\nthe prioritization of scientific use cases, and ensuring that the project meets its goals of scientific impact.\nDr. Heath will oversee and facilitate the completion of the technical milestones and deliverables across all\nCDFE engagements. Dr. Heath will also be responsible for the execution of interoperability strategies with\nCFDE and the NIH IC Stacks. Dr. Ferretti will supervise the KFDRC portal development team and will be\nresponsible for all of their relevant deliverables, such as authentication with NIH RAS and visualization\nintegrations with LINCS. Dr. DiGiovanna will supervise the CAVATICA development team and will be\nresponsible for all of their relevant deliverables, such as GA4GH DRS integration and multi-cloud\ncapabilities.\nCommunication and Data Sharing\nThe PIs will communicate weekly and hold monthly teleconferences with PIs at the other organizations to\ndiscuss the CFDE and all administrative responsibilities. In addition, PIs will meet in person with all\npersonnel at least annually to assess progress and make major decisions about the direction of the\nprogram. If changes are warranted, PIs will work together to discuss those modifications and the\nredistribution of funds, if necessary. A publication policy will be established based on the relative scientific\ncontributions of the PIs and key personnel.
