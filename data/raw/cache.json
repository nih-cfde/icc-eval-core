Many of the current search techniques depend on data descriptors which differ\nacross CF programs and may be incomplete or inaccurate. Many of these experiments output lists of\ngenes significant to certain biomedical conditions. We are proposing to use these gene lists to find\nsimilar data sets. This approach will not only enable searching across CF data sets but also can connect\nthem to other experiments in other databases and biomedical catalogs, e.g., databases containing\ndisease-gene associations and molecular pathways. To achieve this aim, we will implement an efficient\nlinear algorithm to calculate similarities between large numbers of gene sets. Our prototype tool,\nDBRetina, uses this algorithm to build huge similarity networks in few minutes using minimal\ncomputational resources. DBRetina serves as the foundation for CurIndex, a study similarity graph\ndatabase that connects multiple health-related resources. DBRetina and CurIndex will allow advanced\nsearch for related CF experiments and facilitate better interpretation of biomedical data.","project_title":"Data-driven search of Common Fund data sets for better discoverability and novel meta-analysis","phr_text":"Project Narrative\nWe will develop new data-driven search tools to allow advanced search for related Common Fund\nexperiments based on data content rather than metadata annotations. Moreover, these tools will be\nable to provide new insights for meta-analysis by testing for the collective enrichment of related\nexperimental profiles. The resulting enhanced discoverability of CF data sets will support the large scale\nmeta-analysis studies needed to address complex biomedical questions.","spending_categories_desc":"Bioengineering; Dental/Oral and Craniofacial Disease; Genetics; Networking and Information Technology R&D (NITRD)","agency_code":"NIH","covid_response":null,"arra_funded":"N","budget_start":"2022-09-20T12:09:00Z","budget_end":"2025-09-19T12:09:00Z","cfda_code":"310","funding_mechanism":"Non-SBIR/STTR","direct_cost_amt":200000,"indirect_cost_amt":112973,"project_detail_url":"https://reporter.nih.gov/project-details/10577377","date_added":"2022-09-24T04:09:44Z"},{"appl_id":10468521,"subproject_id":null,"fiscal_year":2021,"project_num":"3OT2OD030161-01S2","project_serial_num":"OD030161","organization":{"org_name":"BROAD INSTITUTE, INC.","city":null,"country":null,"org_city":"CAMBRIDGE","org_country":"UNITED STATES","org_state":"MA","org_state_name":null,"dept_type":null,"fips_country_code":null,"org_duns":["623544785"],"org_ueis":["H5G9NWEFHXN4"],"primary_duns":"623544785","primary_uei":"H5G9NWEFHXN4","org_fips":"US","org_ipf_code":"10021177","org_zipcode":"021421027","external_org_id":10021177},"award_type":"3","activity_code":"OT2","award_amount":414060,"is_active":false,"project_num_split":{"appl_type_code":"3","activity_code":"OT2","ic_code":"OD","serial_num":"030161","support_year":"01","full_support_year":"01S2","suffix_code":"S2"},"principal_investigators":[{"profile_id":9237953,"first_name":"KRISTIN","middle_name":"","last_name":"ARDLIE","is_contact_pi":true,"full_name":"KRISTIN  ARDLIE","title":"PRINCIPAL INVESTIGATOR"}],"contact_pi_name":"ARDLIE, KRISTIN ","program_officers":[{"first_name":"George","middle_name":"","last_name":"Papanicolaou","full_name":"George  Papanicolaou"}],"agency_ic_admin":{"code":"OD","abbreviation":"OD","name":"NIH Office of the Director"},"agency_ic_fundings":[{"fy":2021,"code":"OD","name":"NIH Office of the Director","abbreviation":"OD","total_cost":414060,"direct_cost_ic":414060,"indirect_cost_ic":null}],"cong_dist":"MA-07","spending_categories":null,"project_start_date":"2020-09-23T12:09:00Z","project_end_date":"2023-09-22T12:09:00Z","organization_type":{"name":"Research Institutes","code":"20","is_other":false},"geo_lat_lon":{"lon":-71.087893,"lat":42.363082},"opportunity_number":"OTA-20-005","full_study_section":{"srg_code":"ZOD1","srg_flex":null,"sra_designator_code":"SRC","sra_flex_code":null,"group_code":"99","name":"ZOD1-SRC(99)"},"award_notice_date":"2021-09-15T12:09:00Z","is_new":false,"mechanism_code_dc":"OT","core_project_num":"OT2OD030161","terms":null,"pref_terms":null,"abstract_text":"Detailed Engagement Plan\nThe National Institutes of Health Common Fund’s Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx) project was\nlaunched in 2010 with a goal of providing the scientific community with a resource for the study of human\ngene expression and regulation across multiple tissues, to specifically provide insights into the mechanisms\nof gene regulation and disease-related perturbations, and to further our understanding of the role that\ninherited genetic variation plays in susceptibility to complex diseases. The project enrolled 960 recently\ndeceased, adult donors and collected close to 49,000 tissue samples. Core data generation was\ncompleted at the end of 2017, with the primary data types including whole genome (WGS, 30X) and whole\nexome (WES, 100X) sequence data on all donors, and RNA-sequence data from at least 25,000 samples\nspanning 53 human tissues/organs. This dataset constitutes the largest multi-tissue RNA sequence data\nresource generated to date (a previous study of genetic effects on gene expression, TwinsUK/EUROBATS,\ngenerated ~2,700 RNA-seq samples from four accessible tissue sites).

scientific community with a resource for the study of human\ngene expression and regulation across multiple tissues, to specifically provide insights into the mechanisms\nof gene regulation and disease-related perturbations, and to further our understanding of the role that\ninherited genetic variation plays in susceptibility to complex diseases. The project enrolled 960 recently\ndeceased, adult donors and collected close to 49,000 tissue samples. Core data generation was\ncompleted at the end of 2017, with the primary data types including whole genome (WGS, 30X) and whole\nexome (WES, 100X) sequence data on all donors, and RNA-sequence data from at least 25,000 samples\nspanning 53 human tissues/organs. This dataset constitutes the largest multi-tissue RNA sequence data\nresource generated to date (a previous study of genetic effects on gene expression, TwinsUK/EUROBATS,\ngenerated ~2,700 RNA-seq samples from four accessible tissue sites). The GTEx resource also includes\na rich and well annotated collection of donor, sample, and experiment metadata. Furthermore, additional\nmolecular data types, aimed at enhancing the core data sets, are still being produced, including mass\nspectrometry-based proteomics, measurements of DNA methylation, histone marks (ChIP-seq), somatic\nDNA sequencing, and DNase I hypersensitivity sites.\nThe GTEx resource includes both protected-access and open-access data (Fig. 1). The protected-access\ndata include extensive sample, subject and technical metadata and raw sequence BAM files from RNAseq,\nwhole genome (WGS) and whole exome (WES) sequencing, ChIP-seq and m6A RNA-seq, as well as\nprotected data derived from these such as genotype calls in VCF format. An approved dbGaP application\nis required to obtain all protected-access data, including access to the raw sequence data, which are\naccessible on the AnVIL platform (on Google Cloud Platform; GCP). The GTEx data also include a large\namount of open-access data, such as gene and transcript expression quantifications, cis- and trans-expression\nand splicing QTLs, histology images of every tissue, some eGTEx data summaries, the sample\nbiobank, and a very limited set of de-identified sample and subject metadata. All of these public data are\navailable for download, and as interactive visualizations and summary tables on the GTEx portal.\nThe GTEx project has developed an extensive suite of tools and analysis pipelines that have been\nbenchmarked, optimized and implemented in GCP for the project (such as the RNA-seq alignment,\nquantification, and QC pipeline, and the QTL analysis pipeline). These pipelines were also selected by the\nTOPMed project to produce a harmonized resource of RNA sequence data across the large number of\ncohorts being sequenced for that project (>20,000 samples to date); our team was involved in initial\nbenchmarking and harmonization tests of our pipeline across TOPMed sequencing centers and are actively\ninvolved in ongoing data production and analyses. Moreover, very similar pipelines are used by the\nENCODE project, thus facilitating comparisons across large datasets that would be prohibitive in terms of\ncosts and computational resources in the absence of harmonized pipelines. We have also created\nnumerous visualizations developed specifically for the open access data on the GTEx portal. The GTEx\nproject has a very large user community: the GTEx data have the second largest number of Data Access\nRequests for protected data in dbGaP (behind TCGA), and it is the most frequently downloaded dbGaP\nproject. An even larger number of users access the data, tools and interactive visualizations on the GTEx\nportal: in the 2019 calendar year, the GTEx portal had 135,000 users (~12,000-18,000/month) worldwide,\nwith users spiking in October 2019 following the release of the V8 data. The GTEx consortium has published\nnumerous papers describing the dataset and analyses of the data, and two additional data releases are\nstill planned.","project_title":"GTEx engagement with the

biological function or gene target remain\nuncharacterized. To better annotate such disease variants, NIH-funded consortia created comprehensive maps\nof putative regulatory elements and identified SNPs associated with gene expression (eQTLs) for different\ntissues and primary cell types. In parallel, breakthroughs in capturing the 3D genome structure have\ndemonstrated the importance of cell-type-specific physical proximity between genes and their regulatory\nelements. This 3D view provided a new way through which disease-associations of certain variants can be\nexplained. There is an increasing interest in utilization of chromatin loops for GWAS variant annotation, however,\nto the best of our knowledge, there is no comprehensive study incorporating eQTL data and high-resolution\nchromatin looping information across many different matched/related cell types and tissues to interpret GWAS\nvariants identified for a large set of diseases. To goal of this proposal is to utilize NIH Common Fund datasets\n(GTEx and 4D Nucleome) as well as other published chromatin loop and eQTL data to carry out different\nintegrative approaches for better annotation of disease-associated genetic variants. This will lead to the\ndevelopment of a framework and best practices for integrative analysis of loops, eQTLs and GWAS signals. The\ndeveloped framework will be tested on a large number of diseases and disease-relevant cell types to create a\nsubstantial online resource for researchers. For a subset of the studied diseases, for which we have ongoing\nresearch interests, we will further analyze the identified novel genes, genetic variants and overlapping regulatory\nelements to determine potential targets that warrant further investigation.","project_title":"Using Common Fund datasets for prioritization of disease-associated genetic variants","phr_text":"Narrative\nGenome-wide association studies (GWAS) cataloged disease-associated genetic differences (i.e., variants)\nbetween individuals, however, the precise role of these differences in noncoding regions remains largely\nuncharacterized.

(FREEMIND) Program is to develop a diverse workforce in biomedical\nresearch who will also be long-term users of datasets supported by the National Institutes of Health (NIH),\nincluding NIH Common Fund datasets. The proposed program is designed to expand and diversify the pipeline\nof new investigators in biomedical research. The program will include an intensive, two-week, in-person\nbootcamp course at UC San Diego designed around providing hands-on instructional guidance for using data\nfrom two Common Fund Programs, Bridge2AI and SPARC, as well as the NIH All of Us Research Program.\nJointly, these datasets provide a multimodal set of data (e.g. electronic health records [EHRs], imaging data,\nwaveform data, omics data) and offer great potential to train participants of the program in analyzing large\ncomplex datasets across multiple disciplines (diabetes research, neuromodulation, biology, etc.). This program\nwill be led by an interdisciplinary team with a wide range of research expertise and a strong track record of\ntraining, education, and mentorship. Participants will be graduate students, medical students, postdoctoral\nfellows, and early career faculty (early stage investigators). They will engage in virtual didactic instruction both\nbefore and after the bootcamp. The program includes a strong mentoring component, with faculty mentors\nproviding input on designing and executing projects using the NIH-supported datasets. During the bootcamp,\nparticipants will complete projects in small groups and deliver oral presentations to discuss their results. The\neducational program will include instruction on accessing and analyzing these datasets as well as in rigor and\nreproducibility, responsible conduct of research, team science principles, and the practical aspects of\nconducting large-scale, multi-disciplinary scientific collaborations. Innovations in this program include\nleveraging real-life datasets, emphasizing multimodal analyses, and providing intensive guidance in a focused\nformat accessible to a broad array of participants, including clinician-scientists. The program will support\nparticipants as they pursue publication and presentation opportunities to advance their careers.

The overall ecosystem design includes plans for cross-project data\nharvesting and analysis on a collaborative cloud computing platform. While a long-range plan may culminate\nin highly structured analytic workbenches, we propose to use approaches established in the Bioconductor\nproject to design community-driven modular approaches to data structure and interactive analysis of selected\nCommon Fund assets. Our first aim is to produce standard, easy to use interfaces to resources provided in\nthe 4D Nucleome, Illuminating the Druggable Genome, and Genotype-Tissue Expression projects. These\nCommon Fund projects provide data of considerable interest by the general research community, but data\ndiscovery and use is hampered by intrinsic complexity as well as differing access and delivery methods\nadopted by the various Common Fund projects. We will interface well-established data containers and query\nmethods to allow familiar R/Bioconductor programming idioms to work smoothly with resources from the\nselected Common Fund projects. The two-decade history of Bioconductor's approach to modular software\ndesign, documentation, integration, and distribution will sharply increase the likelihood of durable improvement\nin access to and utilization of Common Fund Assets. Our second aim is to leverage the new interfaces and\ncontainers to carry out four analytical projects in the investigation of origins of treatment persistent tumor cells\nin organoid cultures, with the objective of identifying compounds that can attenuate and provide insights into\nepigenetic mechanisms of treatment persistence. The operational and substantive outcomes of this project will\nform the basis of a comprehensive, highly community-driven approach to building strong bridges between\nconsortia innovating at the cutting edge of biotechnology, and scientists innovating in integrative translational\ninference based on genome biology.","project_title":"Durable Common Fund Data Interfaces and Tutorials with Bioconductor","phr_text":"Project Narrative\nThe NIH Common Fund Data Ecosystem collects together a dozen data-rich projects in cutting edge domains\nof molecular biology, neuroscience, and biotechnology.

revolutionized cancer care. A key strategy of cancer immunotherapy is\nto target “non-cell-autonomous” mechanisms of immune surveillance adaptation, achieved via regulating the\nsecretions of immune modulators from cancer cells. Yet, an in silico systematic screen for these targets and\nimmunomodulating agents (potentially therapeutic drugs) remains untested due to a lack of computational tools\nto analyze relevant large-scale database resources. The study is proposed in response to RFA-RM-23-003 to\nmeaningfully integrate multiple NIH Common Fund and other NIH-funded datasets to inform the molecular basis\nof immune surveillance adaptation and screen for potential immunomodulating agents. Our central hypothesis\nis that cancer genomic features captured by deep learning predict cancer cells’ non-cell autonomous signals\ninduced by a compound treatment to modulate immune cells in the tumor microenvironment. We propose to test\nthe hypothesis by developing an innovative and feasible computational framework that is built upon our published\ndeep learning models. Specifically, in Aim 1.1 we propose to identify prognosis-related immune cell types and\nassociated immunologic gene signatures among adult (The Cancer Genome Atlas [TCGA]) and pediatric tumors\n(Gabriella Miller Kids First [Kids First] and Therapeutically Applicable Research To Generate Effective\nTreatments [TARGET]). We will then build a deep learning model to predict the perturbation of the identified\nimmunologic gene signatures induced by a compound in a cancer cell line using the Library of Integrated\nNetwork-based Cellular Signatures (LINCS) data. In Aim 1.2, we will experimentally validate key findings using\nour in-house in vitro models. We have formed a cross-disciplinary team with strong complementary expertise to\nefficiently achieve the proposed goals: dry lab of Dr. Yu-Chiao Chiu (MPI) for cancer bioinformatics, multi-modal\ndata integration, and artificial intelligence; and wet lab of Dr. Yi-Nan Gong (MPI) for cancer immunology,\nimmunotherapy, and tumor cell death mechanisms. Successful completion of the pilot study will produce high-\nimpact preliminary results: i) the first deep learning framework that systematically incorporates multi-modal\ngenomic and pharmacogenomic data to screen for immunomodulating agents, ii) a deeper understanding of the\nmolecular basis of immune surveillance adaptation than was previously possible, and more importantly iii) a set\nof promising targets preliminarily validated in vitro. These preliminary data will lead to a follow-up study to explore\nfunctional and preclinical aspects of our results. We also expect the proposed study to provide a computational\nframework that enhances the utilization and integration of NIH Common Fund data and other publicly available\nlarge datasets.","project_title":"In silico screening for immune surveillance adaptation in cancer using Common Fund data resources","phr_text":"Narrative\nCancer cells use multiple adaptation strategies to evade detection by the immune system, including secreting\nimmune-modulating molecules such as cytokines and chemokines. Taking advantage of the Common Fund and\nother NIH-funded datasets (TCGA, Kids First, TARGET, LINCS, etc.), we will use computer analyses to\nsystematically identify those cancer cell-secreted, immune-modulating molecules, especially those altered by\ncompound treatments. Our work will provide insights into new anti-cancer immunotherapy development.","spending_categories_desc":"Bioengineering; Cancer; Cancer Genomics; Data Science; Dental/Oral and Craniofacial Disease;

Key to the vNN approach\nis an understandable network such as Knowledge Graph that contains rich annotations of\nrelevant entities and relationships among entities organized by integrative data sources. Our\nhypothesis is that organizing and integrating data from the Common Fund Data Ecosystem\n(CFDE) can enhance the explanatory power of vNN to illuminate GWAS results. We propose\ncombining the ROBOKOP Knowledge Graph with diverse biological data from the CFDE, and\nvNN as a knowledge-based architecture to provide high interpretability in supervised learning.\nROBOKOP Knowledge Graph will serve as an organizational hub for integrating CFDE data\nwith existing knowledge. This query-able resource for CFDE data will be our first deliverable.\nWe will extract network-based relationships from this data and train vNN using genotypes and\nphenotypes from T2D-focused GWAS, providing our second deliverable. The trained vNN, our\nthird deliverable, will enable the prediction of T2D phenotypes from genotype data. Lastly, we'll\nprovide the code base as a platform to expand this KG and vNN approach to other GWAS\nstudies and potentially be generalized for genome wide ‘omic analyses with large data sets.","project_title":"GeneSight: Advancing Insights into Complex Genetic Traits through CFDE-Enhanced Knowledge Graphs","phr_text":"Narrative:\nLinking differences in our genes to the molecular and physiological mechanisms underlying\ndisease remains a major challenge.

structural variants (SVs) in patient\ncancer genomes. However, while human cancer types are generally characterized by widespread\ngenomic instability the functional consequences of most structural and copy number variants (CNV)\nremain poorly understood. Critically, it is unknown which of the hundreds to thousands of\ngenomic rearrangements typically observed in a patient tumor are pathogenic and which are non-\nfunctional genomic scars. Because SVs alter the genome at the structural (linear sequence),\ntopological (three-dimensional organization), and phenotypic levels (epigenetic landscape),\nintegrative and multiscale datasets are necessary to correctly predict their impact. This dearth of\nintegrative resources and tools critically limits the medical interpretation of patient genetic data.\nExisting large-scale genomic and proteogenomic cancer characterization efforts, including the\nCommon Fund (CF) Gabriella Miller Kids First (GMKF) data resource provide rich data to link\ngenetic information including SVs with their phenotypic consequences, such as gene expression.\nHowever, these datasets alone are insufficient to provide deep mechanistic and functional insights.\nCF data sets, specifically 4D Nucleome (4DN), Epigenomics (Roadmap), and GTEx provide the\nblueprint to link germline variation, genome topology, and chromatin architecture to gene expression.\nTherefore, we propose the integration of genomic data from patient tumor samples (GMKF), with\nspatial and functional data (4DN, Roadmap, GTEx), which will allow us to elucidate and predict the\npathogenic mechanisms of structural variants:\nAim 1: To create TopVar a data resource to enhance our understanding of the interplay between\ngenome TOPology and structural VARiation. The integrative TopVar resource will provide the\nphenotypic context required to interpret SVs in genetic and biological terms, which will yield testable\nhypotheses regarding their downstream effects.\nAim 2: To develop and evaluate a predictive model of SV pathogenicity across multiple human cancers.\nUsing the structured TopVar data resource, we will implement an interpretable statistical model to\npredict which SVs have an impact on gene expression, utilizing multiple layers of the integrated data.\nThe realization of both aims will represent a proof-of-principle for the utility of TopVar for predictive\nmodeling of SVs in the context of precision oncology. While our proposed study will focus\non interrogating the comprehensive genomic data generated by GMKF (pediatric cancer) and\nCPTAC (adult cancer), it will serve as the foundation for their use within real-time sequencing\nprograms, such as MI-OncoSeq and Peds-MI-OncoSeq, focusing on refractory and metastatic tumors.","project_title":"Unraveling the topological architecture and phenotypic contexture of structural variation","phr_text":"Narrative\nHuman cancers are characterized by widespread genomic instability, but the functional consequences of\nmost structural and copy number variants remain poorly understood yet critically, it is frequently unknown\nwhich of the hundreds of genomic rearrangements typically observed in an individual tumor are drivers\nand which are non-functional genomic scars.

Importantly, the\naggressive therapeutic regiments often lead to debilitating neurological effects. The realization that\ndevelopmental processes critical to brain development are also deregulated in cancer has provided new hope\nfor understanding and treating brain tumors. Indeed, single cell-RNAseq analyses have further demonstrated\nthe role of defects in lineage determination for pediatric brain tumors. To discover novel drivers of tumorigenesis,\nwe will focus on the function of three-dimensional (3D) genome folding in pediatric brain tumors. Indeed, 3D\nchromatin interactions are involved in gene expression regulation, and changes in genome folding are linked to\ncell identity acquisition during development. While there is increasing interest in elucidating the function of 3D\ngenome architecture during developmental processes and in cancer, how the 3D genome is organized in\ndifferent pediatric brain tumors and its roles in tumor formation and progression are unknown. We hypothesize\nthat disrupted 3D genome folding during embryonic or postnatal development alters gene expression leading to\nabnormal cell differentiation and tumorigenesis in the developing brain. To test our hypothesis, we will\ncomprehensively interrogate the genomes of pediatric brain tumors for non-coding variants that may affect 3D\ngenome folding. We will use a deep-learning model called Akita that predicts 3D chromatin interaction\nfrequencies from genome sequence alone. Because Akita only requires DNA sequence as input, we can predict\nthe effect of any variant within a single framework that accommodates single-nucleotide variants (SNVs),\ninsertion/deletions (indels), and structural variation (SVs). Akita will be used with pediatric brain whole genome\nsequences (WGS) from Gabriella Miller Kids First (KF) plus chromatin capture, epigenetic, and expression data\nfrom the 4D Nucleome (4DN) and Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx) programs in the following aims: 1)\nDetermine the 3D genome architecture of Atypical teratoid/rhabdoid tumor AT/RT tumors. We have initiated our\nstudy using AT/RT, tumors thought to be due to defects in early development11 and the most common brain\ntumor in children less than six months of age. 1.A. We will develop a bioinformatics pipeline that uses Akita to\nquantify how much a genetic variant is predicted to disrupt 3D chromatin interactions in AT/RT tumors. 1.B. We\nwill validate and determine the functional relevance of 3D genomic folding disruptions observed in AT/RT tumors.\n2) Determine the 3D genome architecture of malignant pediatric tumors. We will extend our analyses with Akita\nto additional malignant pediatric brain tumors, focusing for this pilot project on the most malignant and treatment\nrefractory tumors. This innovative project, using a new deep-learning tool Akita, will lead to, novel research\nhypotheses and will accelerate the discovery of additional regulators of pediatric cancer tumorigenesis and thus\nto potential therapeutic strategies for these devastating diseases.","project_title":"Deciphering the 3D genome of pediatric brain tumors","phr_text":"Project narrative\nPediatric brain tumors, even with recent progress on the genetic and epigenetic events underlying their biology,\nare the most frequent cause of morbidity in children with solid tumors.

The FAIR\ndata principles state that research data should be “findable, accessible, interoperable, and\nreusable.” Public metabolomics data repositories and large-scale studies supported by the NIH\nCommon Fund, including Metabolomics Workbench and the Integrated Human Microbiome\nProject (iHMP), and other public mass spectrometry data repositories, such as the Global Natural\nProducts Social Molecular Networking (GNPS) and MetaboLights, have made progress in recent\nyears to address the first two FAIR principles by making metabolomics data easily findable and\naccessible. Unfortunately, the final two FAIR principles, which state that data should be\ninteroperable and reusable, have not been adequately addressed yet by the metabolomics\ncommunity. This prevents metabolomics data from multiple relevant studies to be compared and\nco-analyzed. This proposal aims to bridge this interoperability and reusability gap by harmonizing\ncommunity standards and creating accompanying computational tools for data re-analysis.\nSpecifically, this proposal will 1. Standardize and convert mass spectrometry data formats (Aim\n1), 2. Harmonize experimental metadata and analysis results with common controlled vocabulary\nwith consistent semantics across all experiments (Aim 1), 3. Develop web infrastructure to find\nand explore datasets by metadata (Aim 1), and 4. Develop cloud-enabled portable, reusable, and\nscalable co-analysis bioinformatics pipelines (Aim 2). Successful completion of these aims will\ndemocratize the ability for the entire metabolomics community to corroborate published findings,\ndiscover new metabolites that are highlighted only when co-analyzing datasets, and test\ntranslational hypotheses across different model organisms.","project_title":"Cross Repository Metabolomics Data and Workflow Integration","phr_text":"Project Narrative\nThe lack of uniformity in published experimental methods and data is a major impediment for the\nresearch community to compare, corroborate, and build upon biomedical discoveries.

focus of biomedical research. With the advent of the ‘omics sciences, studies including the ongoing\nMolecular Transducers of Physical Activity Consortium (MoTrPAC) and multiple smaller-scale efforts have\nsought to map the “complete” molecular response to acute and chronic exercise. Much research is currently\nfocused on integration of genomics, proteomics and metabolomics data within such studies, but another\nimportant strategy is meta-analysis of distinct data sets to evaluate consistencies and differences in molecular\nresponses observed between different modes of exercise, sex, age, species, and other factors. Of the exercise-\nrelated meta-studies performed to date, most have focused on the genome and transcriptome whereas few have\nincluded metabolomics data. Reasons for this shortcoming include differences in analytical methods,\ninconsistency in compound naming and data reporting, and prevalence of unknown features in untargeted\nmetabolomics data. Unknown metabolite identification and cross-study integration is challenging and requires\napplication of computational and experimental strategies in a coordinated manner. Yet, the potential benefits are\nsubstantial – identification of novel metabolites and detection of consistent patterns of response have led to\nbiological insights relevant to fundamental biology and human health, including exercise.\nUsing data from NIH Common Fund data archives, we propose to develop a multi-study, multi-organism and\nmulti-condition database of identified and unknown exercise responsive features of the metabolome. We will\nintegrate data across studies and, when available, across ‘omes, to prioritize and identify unknowns within this\ndatabase. We will achieve these goals by carrying out two specific aims: 1) We will perform a comprehensive\nsurvey and alignment of exercise-related small molecule features in MotrPAC data and from studies in the\nMetabolomics Workbench. We will use computational tools we have pioneered for metabolomics data cleaning,\ninter-laboratory data alignment, and network- and correlation-based analysis to prioritize unknown features for\nfollow-up. 2) We will systematically track, annotate and identify high-priority exercise-responsive unknown\nfeatures in metabolomics data using software and experimental techniques we and others have devised for\nMS/MS data collection to identify and annotate features not tractable by routine library search. Our study\nrepresents a crucial step between the map-building aims of MoTrPAC and detailed mechanistic studies of\nspecific pathways and that hold potential for human health benefits through targeted interventions. We will share\nour database and associated data with the research community through publications and uploads to public data\narchives. We anticipate our efforts will contribute to improved understanding of the effects of exercise at the\nbiochemical pathway level and will offer targets for future studies to help delineate the mechanisms by which\nsmall molecules contribute to its salutary effects on health.","project_title":"Meta-Analysis of Metabolic Determinants of Exercise Response in Common Funds Data","phr_text":"Project Narrative\nPhysical activity is well-known to have numerous health benefits, but the biochemical mechanisms of these\neffects remain incompletely understood.

Summary\nProf. Oliver Fiehn will work with his key persons, statistician Dr. Christopher Brydges, bioinformatics specialist\nDr. Yuanyue Li and programmer Gert Wohlgemuth (all UC Davis) to generate new pipelines that integrate stool\nmicrobial metagenomics data and stool mass spectrometry data to better associate metabolites with disease\nprogression in inflammatory bowel disease.\nWe will work in consultation with Dr. Clary Clish (Broad Institute) who generated and deposited the data to the\nNIH Common Funds MetabolomicsWorkbench and the iHMP integrated human microbiome data. We will\nprioritize the enormous set of more than 80,000 yet unidentified stool metabolic signals using longitudinal disease\nprogression over 1 year in subjects with inflammatory bowel disease, in comparison to healthy subjects. For this\nlimited set of not more than 1,000 metabolites that will show significant association with health outcomes, we will\nuse all available accurate mass MS/MS data and all stool microbiome data to obtain metabolite class information\nand likely metabolite structures or substructures. Dr. Clish will review our results and share new annotations that\nhis group will release.\nTo this end, we will develop the tools for metabolome predictions that have been built by the KBase collaborative\nresearch consortium over the past 10 years. KBase uses microbial genomic sequences (or even transcriptomics\ndata) to automatically build metabolic pathways through enzyme predictions and gap filling. KBase also\nempowers utilization of microbial communities, modeling import and export of metabolites that other microbes\ncan use as carbon sources. In consultation with Dr. Chris Henry (Argonne National Lab) from the KBase\nconsortium, we will then build pipelines within the KBase environment to include mass spectrometry tools that\nthe Fiehn laboratory has built through its past NIH funding, specifically formula predictions and substructure\npredictions (in MS-FINDER), retention time predictions (in Retip.app), hybrid-shift MS/MS similarity matching (in\nNIST search), and entropy similarity MS/MS matching (in MassBank.us).\nThis specific project will have large impact on other, similar microbiome/metabolome projects that will be\nuploaded to the NIH Common Funds databases in the future. The project addresses the huge complexity in stool\nmetagenomics and stool metabolomics data, and delivers key pipelines (called ‘narratives’ in KBase) that can\nbe used by the research community at large.","project_title":"Integrating metagenomics data into accurate mass stool metabolite identifications","phr_text":"Project Narrative\nUC Davis will use stool metabolites, stool microbial composition data and disease\nprogression data from subjects with inflammatory bowel disease. All data are\ndeposited and publicly available on two NIH Common Funds databases (iHMP and\nthe MetabolomicsWorkbench).\nThe uploaded data set contains more than 80,000 signals with unknown chemical\nstructures. UC Davis will prioritize compound annotations by statistics of disease\noutcomes, and then integrate microbial predictions and cheminformatics tools to\ngreatly enlarge the annotated stool metabolome to better understand, which\nmicrobial metabolites are associated with inflammatory bowel disease.","spending_categories_desc":"Autoimmune Disease; Crohn's Disease; Dental/Oral and Craniofacial

age, our tissues and organs experience molecular and physiological damage that prevents them from\nfunctioning properly and this ultimately leads to disease states. These changes are not only due to the aging\nprocess itself but are largely influenced by the exposome which includes all non-genetic exposures\n(environmental and behavioral). Depending on the complex interaction between the exposome of an individual\nand their genetics, different organs deteriorate over time at a different pace, resulting in tissues with different\nbiological ages within the same individual. As the biological age of a given organ reflects its overall health and\nfunctional capacity, biologically older organs are more likely to cause health problems increasing the risk of\ndiseases. Aging “clocks” powered by omics technologies (transcriptomics, proteomics, epigenomics, etc.) and\nmachine learning methods have been used to approximate the biological age of specific tissues. However,\ntissue-specific clocks require omics data from a biopsy, making clinical adoption impractical. Therefore, there is\na critical need to develop simple diagnostic tools using readily accessible biological material to measure organ-\nspecific aging rates in an individual which can be translated into personalized actionabilities and enable accurate\nevaluation of the efficacy of health-promoting interventions. Using blood, the pipeline of the immune system,\nfrom aging cohorts we and others have demonstrated that accelerated aging, as evidenced by age-related\nchronic inflammation (inflammaging) and dysfunctional immune systems, results in organ dysfunction and an\nelevated risk of disease in older subjects. This is not surprising since inflammaging has been proposed to be a\ncommon denominator of most, if not all, diseases of aging. In this proposal, we hypothesize that the biological\ninformation to investigate the aging rates of a given organ is contained in the blood of the same individual and\nthus, can be estimated using a collection of tissue-specific gene expression signatures matched with those from\nblood samples. Here, we will assemble multiple public domain datasets within and outside of the NIH Common\nFund to create blood-based organ-specific clocks and enable rapid diagnostics of aging rates for a given organ\nin an individual. To do so, we will use transcriptomic data across multiple tissues and matched blood from the\nGenotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx) database to construct a computational framework that calculates the rate\nof aging of 45 tissues in an individual using blood gene expression. We will validate the resulting models to\npredict organ-specific aging in disease states specific to the organ of interest, and we will assess the influence\nof lifestyle factors including diet, exercise and smoking on the aging of different organs using data from the\nFramingham Heart Study. Finally, we will use the Library of Integrated Network-based Cellular Signatures\n(LINCS) to identify candidate compounds that can restore the gene expression changes in the blood associated\nwith tissue aging to optimal levels.","project_title":"Identification of blood biomarkers predictive of organ aging","phr_text":"PROJECT NARRATIVE\nThe proposed research is of significant clinical relevance as it enables the early detection of accumulated tissue\ndamage at the subject level, thereby providing opportunities for developing personalized preventative\ninterventions. Additionally, by predicting tissue aging at the level of individual organs through the analysis of\nblood samples, the proposed study has the potential to avoid unnecessary diagnostic tests and ‘one-size-fits-all’\ntreatment approach or other interventional procedures, resulting in huge cost savings for healthcare systems\nand ultimately benefiting public health. Furthermore, this study also provides new insights into how lifestyle and\nenvironmental cues can differentially impact aging across tissues and proposes a series of candidate compounds\nthat may prevent age-driven tissue damage and diseases.","spending_categories_desc":"Aging; Dental/Oral and Craniofacial Disease; Genetics; Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence; Precision Medicine;

diverse, and complementary multimodal datasets provided by the Common Fund Data Ecosystem's\n(CFDE) Data Coordinating Centers (DCCs) provide exciting opportunities for integrative analysis and\nexploration. Here, we propose a systematic data visualization-driven approach to investigate the model-based\npredictions of the target genes of candidate cis regulatory elements (cCREs). Our project will leverage\nbiomolecular data from key repositories in the CFDE, including the Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx)\nproject, the Human BioMolecular Atlas Program (HuBMAP), the Cellular Senescence Network (SenNet), and\nthe 4D Nucleome (4DN) consortium, and will expand to include genomic data from external large projects\nsuch as the Encyclopedia of DNA Elements (ENCODE) project. Our motivating use case is the integrative\nexploration and validation of predictions for target genes of cCREs in the context of relevant linkage\ndisequilibrium (LD), molecular quantitative trait loci (QTLs), epigenomic, transcriptomic, (spatial and\nnon-spatial) single-cell, and Chromosome Conformation Capture (3C/Hi-C) data. Central to this objective are\n(1) a ﬂexible data management system tailormade for visualization that addresses the challenges of organizing\nprivate and federated public datasets, (2) tools for the creation of custom, interactive exploratory\nvisualizations, and (3) the ability to save and share visualizations in a FAIR manner. To achieve our goals, we\nwill develop the Common Fund Visualization Hub, a cloud-based platform enabling uniﬁed access to data\nresources in the CFDE alongside user-contributed, private data in projects. It will provide a ﬂuid metadata\ntagging system that supports structured and unstructured tags. It will support multiscale, genomic\nvisualization using HiGlass along with a user interface for on-the-ﬂy visualization construction based on the\nGosling visualization grammar. It will also support multimodal data visualization using Vitessce and enhance\nreusability through sharing of visualizations and storytelling features to communicate discovery processes.\nThe Common Fund Visualization Hub will thus facilitate comprehensive data interpretation and\ncommunication through integrative, interactive analysis of diverse genomic and bioimaging datasets. Using\nthis platform, we will evaluate and compare regulatory element-to-gene predictions from leading machine\nlearning models based on diﬀerent evidence-based methodologies.

project will create a CFDE Training Center\n(TC) responsive to the needs of biomedical researchers and current and future CFDE data programs. The\nTC will serve as the central hub for training development, coordination, and evaluation across CFDE\nprograms and data initiatives.\nGoals of the TC are to expand the Common Fund (CF) data userbase, enhance the confidence and\ncomplexity of dataset usage, and increase awareness of the CFDE and resources. Team ORAU proposes to\naccomplish with (1) training intentionally designed to address gaps in the training landscape, (2) outreach\nactivities and a mentoring program designed to support the growing community of CF users, and (3) the\nestablishment of a collaborative and supportive learning community. The TC will provide a dynamic\nsyllabus tailored to meeting the needs of a diverse community of scientists and medical researchers at all\nexperience levels, with focus on postgraduate students and early-stage investigators. The TC will design\nand deliver customized trainings and training tools to address both broad data skills needs and the\ncustomized needs of specific CFDE data initiatives and Data Coordinating Centers. Matching students and\nearly career scientists with experienced bioinformaticians and CF data users, the CFDE Mentoring Program\nwill provide technical and professional guidance to engage learners and encourage careers in bioinformatics\nand data sciences. The TC recruitment and outreach functions will focus on engaging a diverse and equitable\nset of trainers and participants. The learning community will be supported by internal processes and\nfunctions put in place to facilitate communication and collaboration, including a CFDE Trainers Working\nGroup to share best practices and leverage shared resources, a Diversity Committee to ensure diversity,\nequity, inclusion and accessibility (DEIA) is embedded in all activities and processes, a CFDE Landing\nPage on the CFDE Portal providing a public gateway to CFDE training resources, and a CFDE Virtual\nCommunity of Learners providing learning support and guidance to all training participants as well as a\nplatform for communication and engagement.\nDevelopment of the TC will require in-depth landscape analysis to assess, identify, and address the training\nopportunities and needs of the CFDE community. The landscape analysis will include comprehensive gap\nanalysis, examining current tools and processes and training content, systematic literature review, key\ninformant interviews, CF research community survey, and other data gathering from National Institutes of\nHealth (NIH) stakeholders and biomedical community at large. Ongoing evaluation and assessment of\ntraining activities will inform program enhancements and outcomes, achievements, and challenges will be\nreported out to the common fund and other CFDE coordinating centers.\nThe TC will be developed and managed by a qualified and experienced team of training professionals and\ndata scientists from Oak Ridge Associate Universities (ORAU) and BioData Sage LLC, working in close\ncoordination with the CF and the CFDE stakeholder community. Project management processes and\ncontrols will ensure that the TC and affiliated training programs and engagement activities are appropriate,\neffective, and efficient. Program development and management will take an integrated flexible approach,\ncoordinating closely with NIH and integrating feedback and activities from across the CFDE to ensure\nalignment in all areas.","project_title":"Fostering Meaningful Use of Common Fund

as deep learning models promise significant improvements in healthcare efficiency, accuracy, and\nfairness. However, without careful development, these systems might unintentionally exacerbate healthcare\ndisparities. Subtle variations in medical imaging, influenced by factors like a patient's race, gender, or insurance\nstatus, may be imperceptible to humans but can be leveraged by AI algorithms, potentially leading to biased\npredictions.\nThis project seeks to uncover hidden signals in AI models and evaluate their potential effects on fairness. We\nwill utilize three extensive medical imaging datasets from Emory University, encompassing a variety of patient\npopulations and outcomes. Using advanced generative techniques, we will generate synthetic counterparts of\nthese datasets based on demographics, social factors, and clinical variables. Deep learning models will then be\ntrained on both real and synthetic images to predict sociodemographic factors and measure the persistence of\nhidden signals across data types. By exposing models to manipulated synthetic data, we aim to identify potential\nunfair associations undetectable in actual patient data. Additionally, we will condense images into mathematical\nrepresentations and conduct predictive experiments to ascertain if shortcuts are present. Radiologists will\nanalyze simulated videos transitioning images between demographic groups to visualize results and determine\nif these shortcuts hold clinical relevance. Our objective is to develop tools and guidelines fostering the creation\nof reliable AI systems in medical imaging to enhance patient outcomes across all groups.\nOverall, this project combines innovative data generation, predictive modeling, and human-AI collaborative\nevaluation to proactively identify and mitigate unfair bias in healthcare AI. Our findings will help prevent AI from\nperpetuating disparities and ensure it fulfills its potential to provide equitable quality care for diverse populations.","project_title":"Developing a Hive Learning and Datathon Supported Course on Imaging and Multimodal Data for Resource-Limited Institutions (CIMDAR-HIVE)","phr_text":"PROJECT NARRATIVE\nOur education program, CIMDAR-HIVE, is designed to revolutionize health data science education and research,\nparticularly for early-career researchers, postdocs, and faculty from resource-limited institutions (RLIs).

are crucial to the maintenance of proper cell functions in tissues, particularly those,\nlike barrier tissues, that orchestrate complex responses to invading pathogens and environmental

tissue function or disease.\nSingle-cell transcriptomic datasets allow for comprehensive prediction of CCIs in a given disease or tissue of\ninterest. Many computational techniques have been developed to identify ligand-receptor pairs that mediate\nthese CCIs using either bulk and single cell datasets, as well as spatial transcriptomic datasets. However, the\nanalysis of transcriptomics data produces thousands of ligand-receptor interactions that difficult to prioritize for\nexperimental validation. Thus, there is a need for a computational tool that will rank CCIs for experimental\nvalidation. Here we propose to create a database of putative CCIs across several epithelial barrier tissues,\nincluding skin, intestine, and reproductive tissue. We will then employ a ranking system that uses information\nfrom several Common Fund datasets to rank cell-cell interactions for experimental validation. Finally, we will\nvalidate our approach using existing spatial transcriptomic datasets. Overall, the results of this work will\nleverage the wealth of existing data to better contextualize CCIs, allowing the scientific community to prioritize\nnovel CCIs for experimental validation.","project_title":"Leveraging multiple Common Fund datasets to rank cell-cell interactions for faster hypothesis generation","phr_text":"Project Narrative:\nCell-cell interactions (CCIs) are crucial to the maintenance of proper cell functions in tissues, particularly\nbarrier tissues that orchestrate complex responses to invading pathogens and environmental signals.

personnel, and data. The Evaluation Core will be responsible for performing an\nannual evaluation of the CFDE, assessing the program's progress toward its goals. For high-visibility CF\nprograms, undergoing such assessments can enhance their reputation, increase impact, and foster positive\noutcomes. The Evaluation Core will produce annual reports aggregating metrics, interpreting findings, and\nissuing recommendations while providing advice and guidance based on the evaluation process. We propose a\nstakeholder and community informed continuous evaluation and improvement process across the CFDE, utilizing\nour expertise in automated systems, data integration, and stakeholder engagement. Working under the Office of\nStrategic Coordination (OSC) and in collaboration with NIH staff, we will achieve the following aims: 1) establish\nevaluation metrics aligned with CFDE principles through stakeholder engagement, 2) implement processes that\ncontinually integrate resources to gather metrics across CF programs, including the CFDE, 3) develop a report\ngenerator for CF programs and the CFDE to provide dashboards and continuously-updated reports to project\nleaders and stakeholders; 4) engage with CF programs and the CFDE to provide guidance based on findings\nfrom evaluation metrics, understand gaps in metrics and reports, and ensure continuous improvement. Inspired\nby the agile framework, our approach supports annual evaluations while offering immediate feedback for CFDE\ncomponents. This strategy maximizes the core's impact by generating metrics informed by diverse perspectives,\ndeveloping software and automation for evaluating CFDE components, creating integrated reports combining\nnarrative interpretation with quantitative metrics, and implementing agile practices for continuous improvement.\nOur proposed Evaluation Core will provide impartial, transparent, and constructive guidance. Our focus on\ncollaboratively developing principle-guided metrics through stakeholder engagement ensures a smooth\nevaluation process, eliminating unexpected outcomes and fostering a sense of fairness.","project_title":"CONNECT: Collaborative Network for Nurturing Ecosystems of Common Fund Team

resulting in muscle weakness, difficulty speaking and swallowing, and eventually,\nrespiratory failure. There is no known cure and the average life expectancy of an ALS patient is 3-5 years from\nthe time of diagnosis. Therefore, it is important to identify the genetic alterations that are involved in the molecular\npathogenesis of ALS in order to develop targets for therapeutics. Genome-wide occurrence of DNA repeat\nexpansions has been identified as a common genetic cause or marker of several neurodegenerative diseases,\nincluding ALS. Here we propose to survey the whole genome sequencing data from a population of ALS patients\nand healthy individuals for recurrent repeat expansions, correlate these findings with gene expressions, and\nfinally study mechanisms of regulation of identified genes by integration of gene expression, chromatin\naccessibility, and 3D genome organization data. We hypothesize that many of the overlooked repeat expansions\nare located in the non-coding regions of the genome and are involved in regulation of genes that might contribute\nto the death of motor neurons. To this end, we will first identify the recurrent repeat expansions that act as tissue-\nspecific expression quantitative trait loci using GTEx data. We will then integrate multi-omics data from ALS\npatients with 3D genome data from the 4DN project to identify gene regulatory circuitry. We envision that the\nproposed work will allow scientists to generate experimentally testable hypotheses by creating a link between\nnon-coding repeat expansions and genes in a tissue-specific manner and help identify new therapeutic targets.","project_title":"Delineating the functional impact of recurrent repeat expansions in ALS using integrative multiomic analysis","phr_text":"PROJECT NARRATIVE\nAmyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder that affects muscle cells and\nnerve cells in the brain and spinal cord.

uncovered the central role of this microbial community in human health\nand disease. A pressing challenge, however, is the lack of understanding of microbial drug metabolism.\nExperimental studies, clinical observations, and anecdotal examples demonstrate that microbial enzymes alter\ndrugs through common enzymatic transformations such as reduction, hydrolysis, dehydroxylation,\ndemethylation, and others. Despite progress, there lacks a systematic approach for the discovery and analysis\nfor such transformations, thus hindering the design and interpretation of experimental studies. There is therefore\na need to establish workflows to explore such transformations.\nWe investigate in this proposal microbial drug metabolism at the molecular and community levels. We are\nproposing to use data from two Common Fund data sets to conduct this investigation. Illuminating the Druggable\nGenome (IDG) catalogues drugs and their pharmacologic action, while the NIH Human Microbiome Project\n(HMP) provides detailed gut microbial data for cohorts. We are also proposing to use our deep-learning tools to\npredict the likelihood of interaction between microbial enzymes and drugs (Aim 1), and to predict putative\nderivative products due to this interaction (Aim 2). Our tools (CSI for Aim 1, and GNN-SOM and PROXIMAL for\nAim 2) have already been validated on other datasets and in other studies, and they will be adapted for microbial\nenzymes and drugs based on data culled from IDG and HMP and other resources. The workflows established\nin Aims 1 and 2 will be utilized to conduct a pilot study (Aim 3) to investigate the extent of functional redundancy\ntowards drugs within microbial communities of healthy individuals that are culled from HMP.\nThe strength of our Approach therefore lies in: i) adapting novel, state-of-the-art deep-learning models to predict\nmicrobial enzyme promiscuity on drugs, ii) providing biochemically explainable drug products, and iii) exploring\nhow drug microbial metabolism is a function of microbial community composition. The Significance of this\nresearch is that it provides an explainable hypothesis of microbial drug metabolism. The work is impactful as it\nwill enable further studies, such as exploring the functional redundancy of a microbial community towards drugs\n(as planned in Aim 3) and designing and interpreting experimental studies involving the impact of the gut\nmicrobiota on drugs. The proposed work is appropriate for this funding opportunity as it curates and annotates\ndata using novel deep-learning approaches and creates a previously unexplored link between the HMP and IDG.\n1","project_title":"Using Common Fund Datasets to Illuminate Drug-Microbial Interactions","phr_text":"PROJECT NARRATIVE\nThe gut microbiota consists of hundreds or more bacterial species harboring millions of genes.

combination with chromatography provides a powerful approach to characterize\nsmall molecules produced in cells, tissues and other biological systems. In essence, measured metabolites\nprovide a functional readout of cellular state, allowing novel biological studies that advance our understanding\nof health and disease. Currently, the main bottleneck in metabolomics is determining the chemical identities\nassociated with the spectral signatures of measured masses. Despite the growth of spectral databases and\nadvances in annotation tools that recommend the chemical structure that best explains each signature, the large\nmajority of measured masses cannot be assigned a chemical identity. There is now consensus that gleaning\npartial information regarding the measured spectra in terms of chemical substructure or chemical classification\ncan inform biological studies. This consensus is reflected in the newly updated reporting standards for metabolite\nannotation as proposed by the Metabolite Identification Task Group of the Metabolomics Society. As we show\nin our Preliminary Results, spectral characterization results in “features” that can enhance performance in\nmachine-learning tasks such as annotation.\n This work aims to enhance the use and value of the metabolomics dataset in Metabolomics Workbench\nby: (1) developing machine-learning tools trained on this dataset to characterize unknown spectra, and (2) adding\ncharacterization information to the Metabolomics Workbench dataset. In Aim 1, we identify spectral patterns\n(motifs) that can represent chemically meaningful groupings of peaks within the spectra (e.g., peaks associated\nwith aromatic substructures, loss of a substructure fragment, etc.). We utilize neural topic models that use\nvariational inference to identify such motifs. We expect such models to offer computational speedups and to\nidentify more chemically coherent motifs when compared to earlier implementations of topic modeling. We\ngenerate motifs across all spectra in the Metabolomics Workbench and provide annotations for each spectrum.\n In Aim 2, we map spectral signatures to chemical ontology classes. As ontologies are hierarchical and\nas a molecule can be associated with multiple classes at different hierarchical levels of an ontology, we cast this\nmapping problem as a hierarchical multi-label classification problem and use neural networks to implement such\na classifier. The classifier will be trained using the Metabolomics Workbench dataset. Learned motifs from Aim\n1 will be used as additional input features to improve classification. We expect that the developed classifier can\nbe used by others to elucidate measurements of unidentified molecules with chemical ontology classes, or to\ngenerate ontology terms that can be used as features in downstream machine-learning tasks.","project_title":"Using machine learning techniques to characterize the Metabolomics Workbench Dataset","phr_text":"Relevance to Public Health\nThe project proposes to investigate machine learning techniques to enhance the utility of a Common Fund data\nset hosted through the Metabolomics Workbench. This data set consists of biologically relevant molecules and\ninformation about their structural composition and their mass spectrometry signatures. We anticipate that our\ntechniques will result in annotating and adding information to the data set, which in turn will advance\ndiscoveries in biomedical research and have direct benefits to human health.","spending_categories_desc":"Bioengineering; Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence; Networking and Information Technology R&D (NITRD)","agency_code":"NIH","covid_response":null,"arra_funded":"N","budget_start":"2020-09-15T12:09:00Z","budget_end":"2022-08-31T12:08:00Z","cfda_code":"310","funding_mechanism":"Non-SBIR/STTR","direct_cost_amt":175000,"indirect_cost_amt":88120,"project_detail_url":"https://reporter.nih.gov/project-details/10111982","date_added":"2020-09-19T07:09:38Z"},{"appl_id":10132138,"subproject_id":null,"fiscal_year":2020,"project_num":"1OT2OD030164-01","project_serial_num":"OD030164","organization":{"org_name":"UNIVERSITY OF AUCKLAND","city":null,"country":null,"org_city":"AUCKLAND","org_country":"NEW ZEALAND","org_state":null,"org_state_name":null,"dept_type":null,"fips_country_code":null,"org_duns":["590330247"],"org_ueis":["F1EHWJFBEWL8"],"primary_duns":"590330247","primary_uei":"F1EHWJFBEWL8","org_fips":"NZ","org_ipf_code":"586001","org_zipcode":"1010","external_org_id":586001},"award_type":"1","activity_code":"OT2","award_amount":494117,"is_active":false,"project_num_split":{"appl_type_code":"1","activity_code":"OT2","ic_code":"OD","serial_num":"030164","support_year":"01","full_support_year":"01","suffix_code":""},"principal_investigators":[{"profile_id":12251075,"first_name":"Peter","middle_name":"John","last_name":"Hunter","is_contact_pi":true,"full_name":"Peter John Hunter","title":"DIRECTOR OF AUCKLAND BIOENGINEERING INST"},{"profile_id":16414189,"first_name":"Bernard","middle_name":"","last_name":"de Bono","is_contact_pi":false,"full_name":"Bernard  de Bono","title":""}],"contact_pi_name":"HUNTER, PETER JOHN","program_officers":[{"first_name":"Haluk","middle_name":"","last_name":"Resat","full_name":"Haluk  Resat"}],"agency_ic_admin":{"code":"OD","abbreviation":"OD","name":"NIH Office of the Director"},"agency_ic_fundings":[{"fy":2020,"code":"OD","name":"NIH Office of the Director","abbreviation":"OD","total_cost":494117,"direct_cost_ic":355916,"indirect_cost_ic":138201}],"cong_dist":null,"spending_categories":[329],"project_start_date":"2020-09-23T12:09:00Z","project_end_date":"2021-09-22T12:09:00Z","organization_type":{"name":"Unavailable","code":null,"is_other":true},"geo_lat_lon":{"lon":174.76667,"lat":-36.86667},"opportunity_number":"OTA-20-005","full_study_section":{"srg_code":"ZOD1","srg_flex":null,"sra_designator_code":"SRC","sra_flex_code":null,"group_code":"99","name":"ZOD1-SRC(99)"},"award_notice_date":"2020-09-23T12:09:00Z","is_new":false,"mechanism_code_dc":"OT","core_project_num":"OT2OD030164","terms":"<Anatomy><Anatomic><Anatomic Sites><Anatomic structures><Anatomical Sciences><Biomedical Engineering><bio-engineered><bio-engineers><bioengineering><Colon><Heart><Neurology><Drug Kinetics><Pharmacokinetics><Phenotype><Physiology><Semantics><Testing><Tissues><Body Tissues><Work><base><Organ><Procedures><Area><Clinical><pediatric><Childhood><Fostering><Collaborations><scaffolding><scaffold><Knowledge><3-D><3D><three dimensional><3-Dimensional><data management><model-based simulation><models and simulation><Modeling><Molecular><interoperability><Infrastructure><HuBMAP><Human BioMolecular Atlas Program>","pref_terms":"3-Dimensional;Anatomy;Area;Biomedical Engineering;Childhood;Clinical;Collaborations;Colon;Drug Kinetics;Fostering;Heart;Human BioMolecular Atlas Program;Infrastructure;Knowledge;Modeling;Molecular;Neurology;Organ;Phenotype;Physiology;Procedures;Semantics;Testing;Tissues;Work;base;data management;interoperability;models and simulation;scaffold","abstract_text":"The potential impact of the work to be done if it were successfully implemented.\nThis proposal looks to establish three-way collaboration between SPARC, HuBMAP and Kids First\n(SHKF) as a means to develop coherent anatomical knowledge/data management strategies\ninformed by clinical use-cases.

Ecosystem (CFDE). Although there is an enormous potential for the\nlarge datasets available through the CDFE to advance biomedical research, our broad needs assessment has\nidentified that a wide range of researchers lack fundamental skills necessary to use these types of data. Gaps\nwe have identified include identifying the appropriate data sets to answer hypotheses, managing, wrangling,\nand harmonizing data in preparation for analysis, in addition to performing the analyses. We propose to close\nthis gap and accomplish our objects by: 1) Performing a needs assessment of potential Common Fund Data\nusers, targeting early career clinically oriented faculty developing research related to the human microbiome.\n2) Developing curricular materials for knowledge and skills in data science using three datasets developed by\nNIH Common Fund projects related to the human microbiome, microbial products, and clinical associations. 3)\nDelivering a two-week in-person short course on data science to a diverse set of early career learners to\neducate and provide skills necessary for accessing data in the Common Fund Data Ecosystem and\nincorporating these data sources into research. And 4) Providing extended support beyond the short-course\nthrough informatics mentorship to support common fund data use in participant’s area of research. The\nprogram will be led by experts in Biomedical Informatics Education and Microbiome Bioinformatics and be\nsupported by several faculty with expertise and extensive educational experience in data science, clinical\ninformatics, artificial intelligence and machine learning, data visualization, and data management. The short\ncourse will focus on applications of CFDE to address research questions related to the human microbiome in\nhuman health and disease, with a specific focus on diabetes. We anticipate the impact of this program to be\nsubstantial in enabling researchers to improve their use of existing CFDE projects into their own research more\nrapidly and accurately.

Copy-number and sequence\nvariation within multigene families are associated with many phenotypes, human diseases, and evolutionary\nadaptations. Yet systematic incorporation of gene paralog variation into studies of genomic diversity is lacking.\nMost existing tools are not well suited to delineating differences among gene family members or require\nprohibitively large computational resources. We recently developed an approach, QuicK-mer2, which efficiently\nestimates gene copy-number in a paralog specific manner. Application of our approach to data from the 1000\nGenomes Project revealed rare gene-paralog variants that have not been previously reported. Here, we propose\napplication of QuicK-mer2 to create paralog specific copy-number estimates from existing NIH Common Fund\ngenomics data sets. In specific Aim 1, we will analyze genome sequencing data from the Genotype-Tissue\nExpression (GTEx) consortium to define the effect of gene paralog variation on gene expression levels. Although\nwe will assess the entire genome, we will focus our analyses on variation among the largest family of transcription\nfactors, KRAB-ZFPs (Kruppel-related AB box zinc finger proteins), to identify trans-acting expression QTL. In\nspecific Aim 2, we will analyze variation among duplicated genes in the Gabriella Miller Kids First Data Resource\nwith a focus on structural birth defects, a phenotype to which copy-number variation is known to be a key\ncontributor. Many recurrent copy-number variants arise in regions which are flanked by large segments of\nduplicated sequence with a high identity. Many of these regions of segmental duplication also contain members\nof duplicated gene families that have important biological functions. Here, we will focus on discovering previously\nmissed gene copy number variation within the duplicated sequences themselves. Together, completion of these\naims will give a fuller picture of the extent of genomic variation and the impact of differences among gene\nparalogs on gene regulation and disease.","project_title":"Incorporating Analysis of Gene Paralog Variation Into Existing Genomics Datasets","phr_text":"Project Narrative\nVariation among duplicated genes plays a critical role in evolution and disease, but such variants are often\nmissed in routine analyses.

beneficial interventions for health and wellness, though patients with and without chronic disease struggle to exercise enough to garner its benefits. One sought after approach to overcoming these challenges is to provide the benefits of exercise pharmacologically, a so-called \"exercise-in-a-pill\" solution. This involves identifying biomolecular mechanisms responsible for exercise benefits and engaging them pharmacologically using small molecule agents. To accelerate discovery of exercise mimetic drugs, this project synergizes existing data from two National Institutes of Health Common Fund projects. The Molecular Transducers of Physical Activity Consortium (MoTrPAC) provides a map of the biomolecular response to exercise, while the Library of Integrated Network-Based Cellular Signatures (LINGS) Program provides a map of the biomolecular response to small molecule exposure. The investigators hypothesize that biomolecular exercise pathways and small molecule drug candidates from these two resources can be matched by their shared biomolecular \"signatures\". The maps are linked by matching exercise-induced changes in biomolecular expression (i.e., a gene expression \"signature\" of exercise) from MoTrPAC to similar expression changes induced by small molecules found in LINGS. By linking these two data sets, the project will create a detailed, browsable, and interactive resource for identifying potential exercise mimetics. Aim 1 seeks to identify biomolecular signatures of exercise training from MoTrPAC by analyzing publicly released multi-omic response data from MoTrPAC's exercise training studies in young adult rats. Specific objectives include: 1) identifying biomolecular \"signatures\" through gene set enrichment analysis, network clustering, and gene regulatory networks; 2) evaluating the validity and reliability of these signatures across tissues, sexes, and timepoints in the rat study; and 3) generating an annotated database of signatures for alignment with LINGS. Aim 2 integrates MoTrPAC and LINGS biomolecular signatures in a cloud-based infrastructure that matches MoTrPAC signatures with those available from LINGS. This infrastructure will be designed to 1) organize, browse, and fiter the MoTrPAC signatures database; 2) query existing cloud-based applications developed by LINGS for engagement with their library of data; and 3) deliver these results in a visually informative and interactive web application to maximize the user's ability to gain novel insights. Future efforts will expand the infrastructure by adding new MoTrPAC data and annotating exercise signatures with knowledge from other Common Fund datasets. Additionally, the project aims to leverage results to identify and prioritize pathways related to insulin resistance and other diseases for experimentation in model systems. This comprehensive approach seeks to accelerate the identification of exercise mimetics and provide valuable resources to translational researchers and stakeholders in the pharmaceutical pipeline.","project_title":"Synergizing Common Fund Data from MoTrPAC and LINCS for the Discovery of Novel Exercise Mimetic Drugs","phr_text":"PROJECT NARRATIVE\nExercise represents one of the most beneficial things people can do to improve their health, but people often struggle to exercise enough to see the health benefits.

an\nidentified therapeutic option. Advances in genetics and omics technologies coupled with increased availability\nof health data present an opportunity to make precise personalized patient care broadly a clinical reality.\nHowever, the lack of rare disease clinical samples and suitable preclinical models for research and\ndevelopment often makes it difficult to even nominate, let alone test, therapeutic options for these patients. To\naid rare disease research, our long term goal is to develop and apply approaches leveraging multi-omics data\nto nominate and prioritize drug targets and repurposing candidates. In this project, our main objective is to\nconduct a feasibility study based on analyses across NIH Common Fund and other publicly available data,\ndeveloping research methods to support data integration. In Aim 1, we will pursue bioinformatics analysis to\nidentify and improve optimal preclinical rare disease models by piloting approaches for identifying the best cell\nline as an avatar for a given patient (Aim 1a) and for analyzing patient induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)\nprofiles in the context of the most clinically relevant tissue types (Aim 1b). In Aim 2, we will determine and test\nprioritized drug repurposing candidates for rare diseases by implementing transfer learning to project data on\nto cell line-by-perturbation data and identifying drug candidates that might rescue cell physiology deficits (Aim\n2a). We will test top drug repurposing candidates for each phenotype in either patient-derived iPSC cell lines or\nxenograft mouse models and generate and analyze RNA-seq profiles pre- and post-treatment for future use in\nrefining computational models (Aim 2b). We focus here on two rare diseases which both desperately need\nimproved therapeutic options: Friedreich’s ataxia (FRDA) and rare brain tumors including glioblastoma\nmultiforme (GBM). We will use NIH Common Fund data sets specified in this Funding Opportunity\nAnnouncement (GTEx, Kids First, LINCS, and PHAROS), other NIH-supported data sets (TCGA and\nCCLE/DepMap), and RNA-seq data generated in our lab at UAB. Because we are advancing this methodology\nin two disease systems simultaneously, we will demonstrate broad utility of these approaches and ensure a\nhigh chance of success in the one year timeframe. These approaches will be the basis of a conceptual\nframework for subsequent R01-level funding regarding genome-guided precision medicine approaches and\ncomputational methods development, as well as generating hypothesis for future collaborative GBM and FRDA\nresearch projects. The interdisciplinary approaches described here are crucial for advancing bench-to-bedside\nrare disease studies both at UAB, a leader in rare disease diagnosis, as well as in the broader scientific\ncommunity. Upon successful completion of this proposal, we expect our contribution to be advancements to\nboth preclinical modeling of, and prioritizing drug repurposing candidates for rare diseases as well as\ndemonstrate how Common Fund data can be used to accelerate rare disease research.","project_title":"Using Common Fund data to inform rare disease preclinical models and prioritize drug repurposing","phr_text":"The proposed research is relevant to public health because it focuses on developing and applying approaches\nleveraging multi-omics data to nominate and prioritize drug targets and repurposing candidates for rare\ndiseases.

We will perform three integrated tasks during the funding period:\n First, we will integrate data across tissues, species, and omics data type in two NIH Common Fund\nprojects, namely GTEx v8 and MoTrPAC Release v1.0, with the aid of transfer learning methods. Our goal is\nto learn a low-dimension representation of gene expression structure across human tissues that can be\napplied to other datasets to facilitate integrative analysis.\n Second, we will apply an RNA-sequencing guided proteomics pipeline and software that we recently\ndeveloped in order to extract hidden peptide information from Common Fund proteomics data, including\nisoform and post-translational modifications. We will then evaluate the feasibility and utility of integrating\ntranscriptomics and proteomics data to examine multi-tissue correlations in gene expression.\n Lastly, we will utilize this data analysis pipeline in order to predict cross-tissue communication pat-\nterns from transcriptomics and proteomics data, then perform limited experimental validation of the\ncomputational findings using human induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-derived cells. If successful, we\nenvision that the results will inform on data integration strategies that can help further increase the utility of\nlarge-scale proteomics and RNA-seq data in the public domain, as well as generate testable hypotheses on\ngene co-expression across multiple tissues that can inform future work.","project_title":"Investigating systems physiology with multi-omics data","phr_text":"PROJECT NARRATIVE\nWith rapid advances in RNA sequencing and mass spectrometry technologies and the research investments\nfrom NIH, there are now many valuable datasets of gene expression profiles concerning different individuals,\ntissues, and diseases.

Tissue-specific genes show narrow expression, play\nkey roles in maintaining tissue homeostasis and are thought to be good drug candidates. Thus, targeting of\ndysfunctional tissue-specific genes can provide a safer therapeutic approach due to the reduced risk of side\neffects. However, identifying which tissue-specific genes are critical in disease is a bottleneck in drug discovery.\nWe hypothesize that key tissue-specific genes have the ability to spread perturbations in a protein-protein\ninteractome and can be identified by their context specific functionality. This approach offers a paradigm shift\nfrom conventional analyses that uniquely focus on one-gene expression levels. We recently proposed Gene\nUtility Model (GUM) which hypothesizes that it is how a gene is utilized in protein-protein interaction (PPI)\nnetwork dictates its importance in disease development. We will use information flow of a gene within a PPI\nnetwork to represent the gene utility in a given biological state. Under this scenario, genes with high information\nflows (i.e., high gene utilities) in a disease state, instead of gene expression level, are deemed to play more\nimportant roles in disease development. Thus, this application seeks to increase the clinical utility of NIH\nCommon Funds datasets by employing state-of-the-art systems biology approaches to precisely and reliably\nidentifying tissue-specific druggable functional genes (TS-DFGs). We will construct a prototype for Common\nFund Gene Utility Compendium by leveraging four NIH Common Fund datasets: Genotype Tissue Expression\n(GTEx), Library of Integrated Network-based Cellular Signatures (LINCS), Illuminating the Druggable Genome\n(IDG), and 4D Nucleome (4DN). We will focus on three disease types, liver cancer, nonalcoholic fatty liver\ndisease (NAFLD), and Alzheimer's disease (AD) as proof-of-concept studies. In Aim 1, we will uncover highly\nutilized tissue-specific genes across multiple normal tissue types and three selected disease types. We will then\nconstruct utility karyotype to indicate chromosomal regions enriched with highly utilized genes. In Aim 2, we will\nemploy selectivity, controllability, and suitability as criteria to score druggability for TS-DFG candidates with\nrespect to liver cancer, NAFLD, and AD. Druggable utility networks (DUNs) with respect to each disease type\nwill be constructed to assess the distribution of highly score TS-DFGs in a PPI network and signaling pathways.\nThe constructed prototype of the Common Fund Gene Utility Compendium will promote innovative research to\nenhance the usage and provide added clinical value for the NIH Common Fund datasets by offering a new\nparadigm shift for target and drug discovery. Our long-term goal is to enlarge this compendium by including\nmore diseases across different tissue types to facilitate integrative pan-tissue analyses and drive drug\ndiscovery.","project_title":"Common Fund Gene Utility Compendium: A Systems Biology Resource to Explore Tissue-Specific Functional Genes and Druggable Genomes","phr_text":"NARRATIVE\nTargeting tissue-specific genes is a challenging task due to their critical role in maintaining tissue homeostasis\nand physiology, but it can also offer an opportunity to achieve effective and safer therapeutic interventions.

SUMMARY\nIdentifying biomarkers that are diagnostic, robust and generalizable across individuals while possessing\ntherapeutic values is the most wanted endeavor in medicine. However, there are numerous challenges in the\nidentification of such robust therapy-associated biomarkers (TABs). For example, most of the current methods\nseek to achieve statistically significant differential biological signals in general patient cohorts but fail to\nacknowledge heterogenous genetic backgrounds and phenotypic diversity among individual patients. Our recent\nstudies using newly developed machine learning-based feature engineering approaches and conducted in a\npan-cancer study across 12 cancer types showed that biologically constrained features (named herein\ninvariant features) are universal in disease and can be used to classify individual cancers. Importantly, we also\nshow that invariant features can be used to build de novo biological networks and discover network hubs that\ncan be successfully utilized to infer the expression of associated genes. As such, invariant features can act as\ninformation encoders. Using information from Drug Repurposing Hub we show that these hub genes are also\ndrug targets. Collectively, these observations suggest that invariant feature hubs can be TAB candidates. We\npropose that under the new light of biological constraints, we can use a dynamic approach for biomarker\ndiscovery that encapsulates both the genetic heterogeneity and molecular fluctuation across individual patients.\nOur central hypothesis is that disease states show constrains in their molecular activities, and identifiable\ninvariable features possess diagnostic and therapeutic values. The main objective of this proposal is to uncover\nTABs using selected NIH Common Fund datasets (namely, exRNA, GTEx, LINC, and IDG). In Aim 1, we will\ntest the hypothesis that biologically constrained invariant features are universal to most if not all biological states.\nWe will show this by finding invariant features with respect to each biological state from selected Common Fund\ndatasets. We will conduct comparative analyses in disease and normal states in order to dissect disease-specific\ninvariant features. Next, in Aim 2, we will test the hypothesis that invariant feature hubs are TABs. We will show\nthis by determining the diagnostic capability of invariant feature hubs for their “encodability” to reconstruct the\nexpression values of their associated invariant feature genes in different individual patients diagnosed under\nsame disease type. Finally, we will map these invariant feature hubs to IDG and DrugBank to determine their\ndruggability. For those understudied hubs with no known drugs, we will perform computational analyses such as\nhomology modeling and machine learning to characterize their druggability. We expect timely accomplishment\nof proposed aims and successful completion of this project will no doubt provide added values for the selected\nCommon Fund datasets, while providing a new paradigm shift of biomarker and therapeutic target discovery.","project_title":"Uncovering therapeutic-associated biomarkers via machine learning and feature engineering approaches","phr_text":"NARRATIVE\nDiscovering therapy-associated biomarkers is a challenging task due to heterogeneous genetic backgrounds\nand phenotypic molecular fluctuations among patients.

factors for a myriad of human diseases.\nElucidating the genetic basis for smoking and drinking addiction will be critical for public health. In the past few\nyears, the genetic studies of smoking and drinking addiction have made significant progress. With the help of\nlarge datasets and advanced analytical methods, we have identified >400 associated loci in samples of European\nancestry. As a next step, we will expand our study to include samples of non-European populations, in order to\nfurther empower discovery and elucidate the genetic architecture.\nA majority of the identified GWAS loci are non-coding. A critical first step to understand their function is to\nidentify the target gene. Transcriptome-wide association study (TWAS) was proposed to link regulatory variants\nto target genes. In its original form, TWAS integrates eQTL and GWAS data from the matched ancestry. As multi-\nethnic studies become more prevalent, it has been shown that direct integration of European eQTL with non-\nEuropean GWAS would lead to loss of power and the results may be difficult to interpret as well. A majority of\nCommon Funds functional genomic data (e.g., GTEx and 4DN) were primarily from European ancestry. It\nremains unclear whether they remain useful in multi-ethnic studies and if so, how to effectively utilize them.\nHere we propose a series of methodological innovations to combine GTEx data, epigenetic and 3D genomes data\nand other non-European functional genomic data to improve the gene expression prediction accuracy across\ntissue types and ancestries. For a given gene expression model, we will also propose methods to perform provably\noptimal TWAS in multi-ethnic genetic studies. These proposed methods, if successful, will open doors to use\nCommon Funds data in the next generation genetic studies of complex traits in diverse populations. Compared\nto extremely expensive data generation, these method development projects are cost effective and could be highly\nimpactful for maximizing the utility of Common Funds datasets.","project_title":"Methods to maximize the utility of common fund functional genomic data in multi-ethnic genetic studies","phr_text":"NARRATIVE\nSmoking and drinking are major risk factors for a myriad of human diseases, including cancer, cardiovascular\ndisease and respiratory disorders.

The NIH Common Fund GTEx project has revealed tissue-\nspecific gene expression and transcriptional regulation. The NIH Common Fund 4D Nucleome (4DN) project\nhas characterized 3D chromatin interactions in many human tissues and cell types. The ENCODE project and\nthe Roadmap Epigenomic project have profiled tissue-specific epigenomic states and annotated the regulatory\nelements accordingly.\n However, our understanding of human transcriptional regulation remains limited. A major challenge in studying\nEnhancer-Promoter (E-P) interactions is that enhancers are often located tens to hundreds of kilobases distal to\ntheir target genes, yet must physically interact with their target genes to activate them. Therefore, to understand\ngene regulation in human, a necessary first step is to precisely map all E-P interactions. However, current 3D\nmaps of the human genome remain sparse and noisy and fail to detect the vast majority of E-P interactions. In\naddition, the datasets generated from the Common Fund consortia are isolated in terms of cell types and tissue\ntypes covered, how the data are stored, and the resolution of the genomic data, resulting in additional barriers for\nintegrative analysis.\n Here we propose to combine the experimental approach, Region Capture Micro-C, and the deep learning\nalgorithms to accurately quantify E-P interactions. These results enhance the current 3D maps from 4DN and\nENCODE projects. We also plan to integrate experimental and imputed E-P interactions with NIH Common Fund\ndata in a knowledge graph. Our knowledge graph will support efficient cross-modality queries, graph visualization,\nand customized computational modeling for investigating quantitative rules in transcriptional regulation.

In addition,\nsince CF programs have a time limit of 10 years, sustainability of the widely used CF digital\nresources after the programs expire is critical. To address these challenges, the NIH established\nthe Common Fund Data Ecosystem (CFDE) program which has been recently approved to\ncontinue to its second new phase. For the second phase of the CFDE, this project will establish\nthe Data Resource Center (DRC) and the Knowledge Center (KC). Our efforts will culminate in\nproducing The CFDE Workbench which will be composed of three main products: the CFDE\ninformation portal, the CFDE data resource portal, and the CFDE knowledge portal. These three\nweb portals will be full-stack web-based applications with a backend database and will be\nintegrated into one public site.\nThe CFDE information portal will be the entry point to the other two portals. It will contain\ninformation about the CFDE in a dedicated About page, information about each participating and\nnon-participating CF program, information about each data coordination center (DCC), a link to a\ncatalog of CF datasets, and a link to a catalog of CF tools and workflows, news, events, funding\nopportunities, standards and protocols, educational programs and opportunities, social media\nfeeds, and publications.\nThe CFDE data resource portal will contain metadata, data, workflows, and tools which are the\nproducts of the CF programs, and their data coordination centers (DDCs). We will adopt the C2M2\ndata model for storing information about metadata describing DCC datasets.

Integrated Network-based Cellular Signatures (LINCS) program (1) collected massive data\nfrom human cells perturbed by thousands of single small molecules as well as knockouts, knockdowns,\nand over-expression of single genes. The diverse collections of perturbed human cells (n>50) were profiled\nbefore and after the perturbations with an array of omics assays that include transcriptomics, proteomics,\nepigenomics, cell viability, and imaging at different time points and where the small molecules were applied\nin different concentrations. Altogether, over 2 million signatures are expected to be produced and provided\nas a resource for the community for query and reuse at the time when the LINCS program officially ends\n(6/2020). Such a resource can be used for limitless applications, for example, to study molecular\nmechanisms of disease, repurpose existing drugs, predict side effects and indications for pre-clinical small\nmolecules, associate small molecules with the targets that they likely affect directly and indirectly,\nreconstruct cell signaling and gene regulatory networks, understand the global space of all possible cellular\nstates in response to all possible perturbations of all human cells, and many more applications and use\ncases. This utilization of LINCS resources is already happening but can be significantly enhanced via\ncontinued efforts led by the LINCS Data Coordination and Integration Center (DCIC) through interactions\nwith the CFDE and other CF DCCs in the next 3 years.\nSo far, the ~400 publications produced by the LINCS consortium have been cited by ~6,000 other papers,\ndemonstrating the high impact of the program on the research community. In particular, the computational\nresources developed by the LINCS DCIC have been very successful. These tools and databases were\nalready visited by >1 million unique users, with currently ~30,000 unique users per month (based on Google\nAnalytics). These strong usage statistics demonstrate the value of LINCS resources and their potential for\nmaking long-lasting impact on drug discovery, and the biomedical research community in general. The\nLINCS DCIC developed web-based resources to enable the federated access, intuitive querying, and\nintegrative analysis and visualization of the LINCS data combined with other relevant data. To achieve this\nthe LINCS DCIC also processed many additional external data types from other relevant resources to be\nintegrated with LINCS data including data from other Common Fund programs such as GTEx, Epigenomics\nRoadmap, and IMPC. However, such data integration efforts were achieved with little consideration of\ncommunity standards to ensure their long term findability, accessibility, interoperability and reusability\n(FAIR) (2). Our involvement with the NIH Data Commons Pilot Project Consortium (DCPPC) and the\nCommon Fund Data Ecosystem (CFDE) taught us many lessons on how to better achieve data\nharmonization via the adoption of community standards to achieve long term sustainability of LINCS\nresources.

of genotype/phenotype interactions derived from the\nCommon Fund Knockout Mouse Phenotyping Program (KOMP2) and the Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx)\nproject with family cohort data from two Gabriella Miller Kids First Pediatric Research Projects (KF): Genomic\nStudies of Orofacial Cleft Birth Defects and Genomics of Orofacial Cleft Birth Defects in Latin American\nFamilies. Asymmetry is a key feature of numerous developmental disorders including major structural birth\ndefects as well as neurological disorders. A better understanding of the genetic basis of asymmetry and its\nrelationship to disease susceptibility will help unravel the complex genetic and environmental factors and their\ninteractions that increase risk in a wide range of developmental disorders. The KOMP2 project aims to provide\ncomprehensive mouse knockout phenotype data, including 3D fetal imaging of sub-viable and lethal lines that\nare likely to play a significant role in development. In this project, automated, dense quantification of\nasymmetry of 3D embryonic microCT images will be used to build statistical models of asymmetry in normal\ndevelopment. Knockout strains will be screened for phenotypes with asymmetric structures or organs with the\ngoal of detecting genes associated with abnormally heightened asymmetry. The functional significance of the\nselected genes will be validated by comparing regions impacted in knockout strain phenotypes from the\nKOMP2 dataset to tissue expression data from the GTEx project. Candidate genes identified using biological\ninformation from the KOMP2 and GTEx datasets will be explored f or association with the KF whole genome\nsequencing data from OFC parent-case trios with the aim of identifying genetic variants that are enriched in\nthese groups compared to a control population.

The Library of Integrated\nNetwork-based Signatures (LINCS) P100 project has generated targeted (using 96 carefully chosen\nphosphosites) and comprehensive (using DIA, data independent acquisition) mass spectrometry (MS)-based\nphosphoproteomic datasets characterizing cell states perturbed using a collection of common bioactive\ntherapeutic (“known”) compounds. The analysis of phosphoproteomics data acquired using DIA is challenging,\nand as a result the comprehensive LINCS DIA data has not yet been leveraged to its full potential. The Molecular\nTransducers of Physical Activity (MoTrPAC) consortium has also used phosphoproteomics (along with other\nomics data) to quantify the molecular effects of exercise. Using methods like post-translational modification site-\nspecific enrichment analysis (PTM-SEA, Krug et al. MCP, 2019), perturbation-induced phosphorylation\nsignatures can be correlated with exercise-induced phosphorylation changes to identify known compounds that\ncan mimic the effects of physical activity, providing an exciting opportunity to enhance the combined utility and\nimpact of the LINCS and MoTrPAC Common Fund datasets.\nThe goal of our proposal is to test the hypothesis that there are known compounds that can mimic the effects of\nphysical activity. To accomplish this goal, the PTM signatures database (PTMsigDB) will be significantly\nexpanded using the LINCS DIA data.These signatures will then be correlated with phosphoproteomic changes\ninduced by physical activity provided by MoTrPAC to nominate exercise-mimetic drugs.\nWith these goals in mind we will 1) Develop and apply an automated, cloud-based pipeline to greatly expand\nphospho-perturbation profiles from existing LINCS data from 100 to several thousand distinct phosphosites; 2)\nDerive perturbation-specific phosphoproteomic signatures from the greatly expanded phospho-profiling data;\nand 3) Identify exercise mimetic drugs using PTM signature enrichment in MoTrPAC phosphoproteomic data\nfrom acute and long-term exercise. Successful application of the proposed strategy will nominate a list of\nexercise-mimetic drugs with the potential to initiate entirely new avenues of research focused on finding new\ntherapeutic approaches to combat aging or muscle wasting (cachexia) in cancer patients.","project_title":"Using phosphorylation signatures of drug perturbagens to identify exercise-mimetic compounds","phr_text":"Project Narrative:\nRepurposing of existing drugs to treat diseases outside the scope of the original medical indication is increasingly\nbeing explored.

data that can provide vital context,\norigin, and, in some instances, quantitative inferences for biomarkers. However, the systematic harmonization\nand organization of biomarker data, as well as their connections to CF data, remain in an early stage and is\ncurrently the focus of the year-long Common Fund Data Ecosystem (CFDE) Biomarker-Partnership project that\naims to develop a working biomarker data model. The proposed BiomarkerKB project aims to refine and\npopulate the biomarker data model through a close and dynamic external partnership with the NCI-supported\nEarly Detection Research Network (EDRN) with built-in community input mechanisms. The initial focus is on\nrefining our current biomarker data model using EDRN's cancer biomarker data and knowledge. Initially\nfocusing on cancer will allow us to limit our scope while retaining the ability to evaluate a variety of data types\nand therefore ensure extensibility of the model as new data types and technologies emerge. The Minimal\nViable Product (MVP) will include persistent biomarker identifiers, linked data, connections to recognized\nstandards and ontologies, downloads/APIs, and data access through interfaces for biomarker explorations.\nThis data model will serve as the cornerstone for AI-ready datasets, machine learning-based biomarker\nprediction models, and biomarker knowledge graphs. The scientific use case the project proposes to support is\nthe ability to explore molecular biomarker-related knowledge for most prevalent cancers at a systems level,\ncategorized by biological functions through mapping to key ontologies, pathways, biomolecular data (glycans,\nproteins, genes, metabolites) and Electronic Health Record (EHR) terms and tests. Example biomarkers\n(including non-molecular ones that are of interest to Data Coordinating Centers (DCCs)) for other diseases will\nalso be considered to ensure the comprehensiveness and robustness of the data model. This project promises\nto enrich our understanding of the translational health record and intervention space, revolutionizing the way\nwe approach diverse diseases, clinical assays, molecular mechanisms, and disease classifications. The\npotential benefits extend to our partners in the EDRN and the broader CFDE community, underscoring the\nreal-world significance of biomarkers across the medical and research landscape.","project_title":"Enhancing and making Biomarker Knowledge FAIR using contextual CFDE data","phr_text":"The proposed project will establish a structured representation of biomarkers of clinical interest, with links to\nrelated knowledge models (e.g. genes, proteins, glycans, metabolites, disease, phenotype, cell, tissue, and\nEHR codes).

As the pace of WGS\naccelerates, the interpretation of the 99% of variants revealed by WGS that are non-coding is of\nincreasing importance. High-volume “omic” profiling datasets generated by Common Fund projects and\nderived information about specific variants and regulatory elements have great potential to inform the\ninterpretation of such non-coding variants. NIH CF Roadmap Epigenome, GTEx and CF Extracellular\nRNA Communication Consortium (CF ERCC) already generate publicly shareable information about the\nimpact of individual regulatory variants in the form of allele-specific DNA methylation, chromatin states,\ntranscription factor binding, phased allelic transcription, e/sQTL information, and transcription status of\nnon-coding and coding variants. More detailed information that may help evaluate functional effects of a\nvariant in specific haplotype and tissue contexts can be gleaned from privacy-protected multi-omic\nprofiles of biosamples containing the variant. Both the summary-level and the protected variant\ninformation is currently fragmented, poorly accessible and lacks interoperability.\nThe scope of this project. By\nleveraging resources from the CF ERCC\nand NHGRI ClinGen projects (Table 1),\nwe will unlock the value of variant\ninformation across Common Fund\nprojects. One immediate aim will be to\nimprove FAIRness of Extracellular RNA\nCommunication Consortium (ERCC)\ndata and make it accessible via the\nCFDE Data Portal. Additional two aims\ncut across CF projects and involve the\ndevelopment of infrastructure for\n“genomic indexing”, i.e., for aggregating\nvariant information across CF projects\nand for making the information FAIR and useful in both the research and clinical use cases. The\ninformation will be aggregated at the summary-level that does not compromise identity of participants and\nalso at the more detailed level that will be protected and will involve authorized access. We will initiate the\ncross-CF integration with variant information from Roadmap Epigenome, GTEx, and the Extracellular\nRNA Communication Consortium (ERCC) projects. In collaboration with GTEx (see letter from Dr. Kristin\nArdlie, GTEx PI), we will make the aggregated variant information accessible via web UIs and APIs\nhosted at the CFDE Data Portal.\nThe research and clinical diagnostic use cases. The research use cases will come from the NIH\nCommon Fund Gabriella Miller Kids First-KOMP2 (see letters from Dr. Bruce Gelb, KidsFirst-KOMP2 PI,\nand Dr. Sharon Plon, KidsFirst PI). The clinical diagnostic use cases will come from the NHGRI Clinical\nGenome Resource (ClinGen) project (see letter from Dr. Sharon Plon, ClinGen PI).

The\ninformation will be aggregated at the summary-level that does not compromise identity of participants and\nalso at the more detailed level that will be protected and will involve authorized access. We will initiate the\ncross-CF integration with variant information from Roadmap Epigenome, GTEx, and the Extracellular\nRNA Communication Consortium (ERCC) projects. In collaboration with GTEx (see letter from Dr. Kristin\nArdlie, GTEx PI), we will make the aggregated variant information accessible via web UIs and APIs\nhosted at the CFDE Data Portal.\nThe research and clinical diagnostic use cases. The research use cases will come from the NIH\nCommon Fund Gabriella Miller Kids First-KOMP2 (see letters from Dr. Bruce Gelb, KidsFirst-KOMP2 PI,\nand Dr. Sharon Plon, KidsFirst PI). The clinical diagnostic use cases will come from the NHGRI Clinical\nGenome Resource (ClinGen) project (see letter from Dr. Sharon Plon, ClinGen PI). In collaboration with\nthese projects, we will develop data models, data flows, system designs, and will participate in the\nvalidation of the systems. This collaboration between Drs. Gelb, Plon and Milosavljevic will build on\nseveral years of their previous collaboration within ClinGen where Dr. Gelb co-chairs the RASopathy\nExpert Panel and Drs. Plon and Milosavljevic serve on the ClinGen Steering Committee.\nFOA Areas addressed. As described below, our project will partner with CFDE-CC in the following two\nAreas listed in the FOA: Area 1 (Enabling access to, and computation across, multiple data sets in a\ncloud environment – addressed in this Section) and Area 3 (Enabling end-users to compute on data in the\ncloud – addressed in Section 2).","project_title":"GENOMIC INDEXING OF COMMON FUND

researchers to annotate CREs across many biological contexts. However, despite the comprehensiveness of these collections, understanding the rules dictating how CREs regulate genes remains a major unresolved problem in genomics. Therefore, to better understand gene regulation, we are proposing to develop a new framework where CRE-gene interactions are modeled as graphs. This will enable researchers to accomplish a wide range of computational tasks such as comparisons between cell types, predictions of new interactions, and predictions of gene expression. Specifically, this pilot project aims to evaluate the feasibility and generalizability of a CRE-interaction graph approach for predicting gene expression. We will build CRE-interaction graphs in three biological contexts using public datasets, including those generated by Common Fund projects, by integrating genomic interaction data, such as CRISPR perturbations and Hi-C loops, with annotated CREs. Then to demonstrate the utility of these graph models, we will use graph neural networks to predict gene expression, testing different algorithms and gene expression qualifications to maximize model performance. Finally, we will use feature attribution methods and prediction explainer algorithms to interpret our models to gain a better understanding of the mechanisms regulating transcription. The project will not only lead to a better model for predicting gene expression, but also establish a flexible framework for future research on gene regulation. The project will also produce a resource for the computational and machine learning community and improve the utility of existing resources.","project_title":"Evaluating the utility of cis-regulatory element graphs for modeling gene regulation","phr_text":"Project Narrative\nCis-regulatory elements (CREs) play a key role in transcriptional regulation.

Therefore, it is much harder to both find relevant metabolomics datasets from repositories\nlike Metabolomics Workbench (MWbench) and effectively reuse these datasets to generate and/or test\nhypotheses. To address these difficulties in reusing metabolomics datasets, deposition quality must be\nimproved. Furthermore, methods that enable the effective search and harmonization of MWbench studies are\nneeded, especially for integrative multi-omics analyses. We are the developers of the only set of available open-\nsource tools for parsing, generating, and validating mwTab formatted repository files. Our experience developing\nand utilizing this open-source mwtab Python package makes us uniquely qualified to develop methods to\nimprove both deposition and FAIRness of MWbench studies. Also, we have provided periodic feedback to\nMWbench based on systematic evaluations of the repository to enable the improvement of this growing public\nresource (2). Therefore, we propose to develop methods and open-source tools that will improve deposition\nquality and FAIRness of MWbench through the following specific aims: Aim 1: Enable comprehensive capture,\ndeposition, and validation of metabolomics experimental data and metadata; Aim 2: Improve the FAIRness of\nMetabolomics Workbench while demonstrating effective multi-omics integration with the Genotype-Tissue\nExpression Project (GTEx). The major innovations that this proposal will develop are: i) effective metadata\ncapture methods from unstructured formats, ii) advanced search methods for relevant MWbench studies that\ncan filter on metadata quality, iii) effective harmonization methods for MWbench studies, iv) new omics\nintegration approach to detect human gene-metabolite associations, and v) new tools that facilitate public\ndeposition with high-quality metadata, with InChI tags, and in mwTab format for quicker, easier deposition.\n The significance of this proposal is in developing methods and tools that: a) comprehensively\ncapture, validate, and deposit metadata-rich metabolomics data, b) improve the FAIRness of MWbench datasets,\nespecially reuse, c) enable integration of MWbench and GTEx datasets to generate biomedically-relevant human\ngene-metabolite associations, and d) enable interpretation of gene-metabolite associations within molecular\ninteraction networks.

These diseases are typically single-gene disorders. Some\nmay cause developmental defects in early eye formation, others cause the degeneration of photoreceptor\ncells, while others may cause anterior segment disease. Historically they have been classified based on the\nclinical phenotype and then grouped into various disease entities. Retinitis pigmentosa (RP), an example of a\nrod-cone dystrophy, is the most common form of inherited retinal disease. It has a constellation of classical\nfindings observed on eye examination accompanied by progressive loss of rod and then cone photoreceptors\nleading to eventual blindness in late stages of the disease. In the past three decades the genetic basis of many\nforms of inherited retinal diseases, for example, have been discovered leading to the identification of over 270\nretinal disease genes. Mutations of over 80 genes are known to be associated with RP alone. However, in\nspite of the tremendous progress that has been made, the identification of the causative genetic alteration can\nbe identified in only 50-75% of patients with presumed inherited retinal disease, even after whole genome\nsequencing. Based on this fact, it is presumed that significant numbers of unknown ocular disease genes exist.\nOne approach to identify additional ocular disease genes in the mammalian retina is to take advantage of\nknockout mouse technology. The Knockout Mouse Phenotyping (KOMP) program is part of the International\nMouse Phenotyping Consortium (IMPC), a group of scientists from mouse clinics around the world with the\ncommon goal of creating single gene knockout mice for every gene in the mouse genome. To date, over 7,000\nsingle gene knockout mice have been created and phenotyped of the ~24,000 protein coding genes in the\nmouse genome. The UC Davis Mouse Biology Program is one of just three KOMP/IMPC centers in the US and\ngenerates a large number of knockout mice for the KOMP pipeline. Mouse knockouts receive comprehensive\nphenotyping in every organ system in the first four months of life prior to necropsy and histopathology.\nKnockout lines are annotated for dozens of specific eye abnormalities which are carefully documented during\nthe phenotyping process. Identification of ocular disease genes in knockout mice provides candidate eye\ndisease genes relevant in people. This proposal seeks to close the gap on the remaining 25-50% of patients\nwith presumed inherited ocular diseases that currently cannot be genetically diagnosed. In this project we will\nidentify all mouse retinal disease genes identified by the KOMP. In addition, we will correlate these novel\nmouse ocular disease genes for human relevance by cross referencing with the GTEx data base, also\nsupported by the Common Fund. Furthermore, we will deeply analyze the specific cell biology of novel genes,\nby literature search, Gene Ontology, Panther Pathway, STRING, Syscilia, CiliaCarta, and publicly available\nophthalmic GWAS. This proposal will catalyze discoveries and generate novel hypotheses based on clinically\nrelevant pathways previously unimplicated in eye disease.","project_title":"Interrogation and Interpretation

molecules rather than random distribution throughout the cell.\nWith improved subcellular localization and enhanced concentration, a specific molecule can be more\nefficacious as well as less toxic which is usually a concern of random distribution and nonspecific localization.\nTherefore, understanding subcellular distribution and the mechanism for a specific molecule can further\nmodulate subcellular dysfunction mediated diseases. Xenobiotic localization at the subcellular level has a\nprofound effect on several processes. The overarching goal of the proposed work is to develop a novel\nplatform with computational tools for specific xenobiotic localization. The proposed work will take advantage of\nthree common fund datasets. In specific aim-1, we aim to develop a suite of machine learning (ML) models for\nhierarchical levels of micro-compartmentation and 40 specific subcellular locations. These machine learning\nmodels will be first built using three different types of features (fingerprints-based, pharmacophore-based, and\nphysicochemical descriptors-based). Then, they are fused using an advanced multilayer combinatorial fusion\nalgorithm to get the best consensus model. We will also perform the scaffold analysis to identify critical\nscaffolds that play a role in accumulating molecules at specific subcellular locations. In specific aim-2, we will\nconduct experimental validation of the predictions developed ML models. More specifically we will test 50\ncompounds for their subcellular location. In specific aim-3, we plan to build an open portal that incorporates\ndatasets, ML model, prediction server, and documentation. All the data and models generated from the project\nare made available as open-source.","project_title":"Using Common Fund datasets for xenobiotic localization","phr_text":"Project Narrative\n We propose to develop a novel platform to predict xenobiotic localization at the subcellular level by\nleveraging and integrating various Common Fund data sets.

drugs. Much of this arises from the disconnect between the inhibitory nature of drug molecules\nand a predominance of loss-of-function mechanisms in such diseases. There has been a growing appreciation\nof the role of gain-of-function variants in this context, especially towards drug repurposing. More specifically,\nwe and others have shown that even subtle changes in function such as alterations of post-translational\nmodification or molecular interaction sites can frequently lead to such disorders. It is unclear to what extent\nthese observations generalize and are actionable from a therapeutic perspective. Common Fund data sets\nsuch as those from the Gabriella Miller Kids First, Undiagnosed Disease Network, the Illuminating the\nDruggable Genome and LINCS programs provide a unique opportunity to assess this computationally. Our\ncentral hypothesis is that gain-of-function variants account for a much larger proportion of rare genetic\ndiseases than currently known and in silico functional profiling can be used to computationally identify such\ndiseases. The proposed work will test this hypothesis through two aims. In Aim 1, we will apply our previously-\ndeveloped predictors of variant impact towards the identification of known and predicted disease-associated\nvariants in large Common Fund genomic data sets. In Aim 2, we will subset out those variants that impact\ndruggable biochemical properties either directly or indirectly, to thus, infer novel drug-disease pairs. Over the\naward period, the principal investigator (PI) will leverage his and his team's expertise in variant interpretation,\nmachine learning and bioinformatics knowledgebases towards the systematic integration of genomic and drug-\nrelated data from multiple Common Fund data sets to identify candidate drugs that can be repurposed for rare\ngenetic diseases. This work will be carried out at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, home to world-\nrenowned researchers in human disease genetics, robust computational infrastructure, and a thriving\nbiomedical data science training environment. The proposed research will not only provide valuable pilot data\nfor experimental validation of promising drug repurposing candidates but will serve as the foundation for future\ncomputational methodology development that will expand the scope of variants and mechanisms that can be\nqueried. The work is expected to have broad impact, as it presents a new mechanism-centric, data-driven\napproach to identifying drug repurposing candidates for rare genetic diseases, that is generalizable to other\nsituations.","project_title":"Variant impact prediction on Common Fund data sets towards drug repurposing for rare genetic diseases","phr_text":"PROJECT NARRATIVE\nDrug repurposing has emerged as an important therapeutic strategy in the context of rare genetic diseases.\nDue to the mostly inhibitory nature of existing drug molecules, they are most effective on genetic variants that\nare likely to increase a protein's function, but the identification of such variants remains an open challenge. The\nobjective of the proposed research is to apply variant impact prediction methods and other computational\napproaches, on publicly available Common Fund data sets to: (1) identify disease-associated variants that\nincrease the propensity for specific biochemical functions in proteins, and (2) identify candidate drug molecules\nthat directly or indirectly inhibit these functions.","spending_categories_desc":null,"agency_code":"NIH","covid_response":null,"arra_funded":"N","budget_start":"2024-09-05T12:09:00Z","budget_end":"2025-09-04T12:09:00Z","cfda_code":"310","funding_mechanism":"Non-SBIR/STTR","direct_cost_amt":200000,"indirect_cost_amt":138000,"project_detail_url":"https://reporter.nih.gov/project-details/10988576","date_added":"2024-09-07T04:09:48Z"},{"appl_id":10876611,"subproject_id":"9429","fiscal_year":2024,"project_num":"1U54OD036472-01","project_serial_num":"OD036472","organization":{"org_name":"UNIVERSITY

interdisciplinary team who has been a part of the CFDE community since 2014. Our\nteam offer 20+ years of combined experience in data repositories, data management, cloud computing, and\nFAIR data. We are excited for this opportunity to establish the CFDE ICC Sustainability Core (ICC-SC),\nto facilitate successful transition of CF program digital assets, including their datasets, software tools\nand workflows, as well as e-Learning materials. We are committed to sustain the wealth of knowledge\ncontributed by the CF programs via education, outreach, and dissemination programs. Our ICC-SC\nteam will serve as ambassadors to advocate and to champion the grand accomplishments of the CFDE\ncommunity. In view of our opportunities and challenges, we propose a CF program digital asset transfer\nstrategy with 3 specific aims as well as 7 supporting, interconnected, multi-dimensional, and action-packed\nmilestones and deliverables (see details in the section of Research Strategy).\nBriefly, to enable smooth digital asset transitioning efforts and to maximize dissemination and community re-\nuse, we define five action items to guide CF digital asset transfer: Meet, Assess, Transfer, Coordinate,\nHandover (MATCH). Meet. At launch, the ICC-SC, we will invite CF program representatives to meet with\nsuitable NIH IC-specific, specialized, and public repositories to identify challenges and opportunities in\n2-3 matchmaking conferences. Assess. The ICC-SC will help identify needs of both parties to collaborate on a\nstewardship plan following the devised diversity, equity, inclusion, and accessibility (DEIA) minded standard\noperation protocols (SOPs) for the CF Digital Asset Transfer. Transfer. The process of comprehensive and\nsecure digital transfer will begin with CF programs creating an inventory for all relevant digital files and\nmetadata. Coordinate. The ICC-SC will facilitate a transition period, coordinating closely with both parties\nto ensure smooth transition of stewardship. The ICC will monitor the secure relocation of assets and\nimplement backup, versioning, and recovery strategies where applicable. Handover. Following transition,\nresponsibilities will be handed over to the new steward, with partial ownership by CF programs negotiated\nwhere applicable. To facilitate MATCH, we will construct a web-based application, the “CFDE Digital Asset\nRepository Roadmap” linked under the CFDE portal; it will connect CF programs online with suitable IC-\nspecific, specialized, and public repositories. In collaboration with the Evaluation Core at ICC, we will\nimplement periodical review of our progress and we will refine our strategy to assure program success\nmoving forward. In summary, our efforts will showcase CF program success, amplify their impacts, and\nextend this invaluable treasure to benefit the wider biomedical community, and to inspire new innovations.","project_title":"CONNECT: Collaborative Network for Nurturing Ecosystems of Common Fund Team Science","phr_text":null,"spending_categories_desc":null,"agency_code":"NIH","covid_response":null,"arra_funded":"N","budget_start":"2024-04-01T12:04:00Z","budget_end":"2025-03-31T12:03:00Z","cfda_code":null,"funding_mechanism":"Research Centers","direct_cost_amt":424652,"indirect_cost_amt":68899,"project_detail_url":"https://reporter.nih.gov/project-details/10876611","date_added":"2024-04-06T04:04:19Z"},{"appl_id":10683508,"subproject_id":null,"fiscal_year":2022,"project_num":"3OT2OD030162-01S3","project_serial_num":"OD030162","organization":{"org_name":"CHILDREN'S HOSP OF PHILADELPHIA","city":null,"country":null,"org_city":"PHILADELPHIA","org_country":"UNITED STATES","org_state":"PA","org_state_name":null,"dept_type":null,"fips_country_code":null,"org_duns":["073757627"],"org_ueis":["G7MQPLSUX1L4"],"primary_duns":"073757627","primary_uei":"G7MQPLSUX1L4","org_fips":"US","org_ipf_code":"1499101","org_zipcode":"191462305","external_org_id":1499101},"award_type":"3","activity_code":"OT2","award_amount":3224707,"is_active":false,"project_num_split":{"appl_type_code":"3","activity_code":"OT2","ic_code":"OD","serial_num":"030162","support_year":"01","full_support_year":"01S3","suffix_code":"S3"},"principal_investigators":[{"profile_id":14376558,"first_name":"Jack","middle_name":"","last_name":"DiGiovanna","is_contact_pi":false,"full_name":"Jack  DiGiovanna","title":""},{"profile_id":10817313,"first_name":"Vincent","middle_name":"","last_name":"Ferretti","is_contact_pi":false,"full_name":"Vincent  Ferretti","title":""},{"profile_id":14887857,"first_name":"Allison","middle_name":"","last_name":"Heath","is_contact_pi":false,"full_name":"Allison  Heath","title":""},{"profile_id":9238231,"first_name":"Adam","middle_name":"Cain","last_name":"Resnick","is_contact_pi":true,"full_name":"Adam Cain Resnick","title":"CENTER DIRECTOR"},{"profile_id":9254652,"first_name":"Deanne","middle_name":"Marie","last_name":"Taylor","is_contact_pi":false,"full_name":"Deanne Marie Taylor","title":"DIRECTOR OF BIOINFORMATICS"}],"contact_pi_name":"RESNICK, ADAM CAIN","program_officers":[{"first_name":"George","middle_name":"","last_name":"Papanicolaou","full_name":"George  Papanicolaou"}],"agency_ic_admin":{"code":"OD","abbreviation":"OD","name":"NIH Office of the Director"},"agency_ic_fundings":[{"fy":2022,"code":"OD","name":"NIH Office of the Director","abbreviation":"OD","total_cost":3224707,"direct_cost_ic":3224707,"indirect_cost_ic":0}],"cong_dist":"PA-03","spending_categories":[132,4531,329,679,2310,729],"project_start_date":"2020-09-25T12:09:00Z","project_end_date":"2023-09-24T12:09:00Z","organization_type":{"name":"Independent Hospitals","code":"30","is_other":false},"geo_lat_lon":{"lon":-75.196604,"lat":39.946632},"opportunity_number":"OTA-20-005","full_study_section":{"srg_code":"ZOD1","srg_flex":null,"sra_designator_code":"SRC","sra_flex_code":null,"group_code":"99","name":"ZOD1-SRC(99)"},"award_notice_date":"2022-09-21T12:09:00Z","is_new":false,"mechanism_code_dc":"OT","core_project_num":"OT2OD030162","terms":"<Future><Funding><Data><Text><data resource><data ecosystem><data sharing ecosystem>","pref_terms":"Data;Funding;Future;Text;data ecosystem;data resource","abstract_text":"Rationale for Multiple PI Proposal\nThis proposal focuses on activities and collaborations with an initial set of Common Fund DCCs and the\nCFDE-CC in response to the Engagement Opportunity “Engaging Common Fund Data Coordinating\nCenters to Establish the Common Fund Data Ecosystem (CFDE)” OTA-20-2005.

No pharmacotherapies target CRF, and while\nexercise training (ET) remains the only established means to improve fitness, substantial inter-individual\nvariability exists in both its intrinsic (untrained) level as well as its response to ET. Limited information exists\nregarding CRF’s underlying biology and identifying its molecular underpinnings may help inform our\nunderstanding of the determinants of this clinically important trait. Emerging data highlight circulating\nbiochemicals, and in particular proteins, as mediators of exercise’s health benefits (“exerkines”).\nTo better understand the molecular pathways involved in exercise and CRF, the NIH Common Fund created\nMoTrPAC, the most comprehensive effort to study human exercise to date. MoTrPAC includes gold-standard\nmeasures of CRF (VO2max), and deep molecular profiling - including whole genome sequencing (WGS) and\nlarge-scale plasma proteomics. Moreover, the MoTrPAC study designs utilizes a randomized, controlled trial of\nET with a non-exercise control arm to allow for the identification of determinants of VO2max changes in\nresponse to ET (VO2max). Though the generation of large multi-omics data in MoTrPAC presents enormous\nopportunity, a major challenge remains in identifying the most promising biochemical determinants of CRF to\nbe brought forth for further, mechanistic studies. We and others have previously shown that integrating\ngenetics, proteomics, and functional genomics (e.g. tissue expression and knockout models) using statistical\ncolocalization can inform understanding about a protein’s regulation and suggest a causal role in health and\ndisease. These studies can, in effect, prioritize plasma proteins to be triaged for further investigation.\nThis proposal integrates plasma proteomics, WGS and VO2max traits from MoTrPAC with tissue expression\ndata from GTEx to prioritize candidate protein determinants of CRF. In Aim 1, we will apply a novel 5,000\nassay plasma proteomics platform (Olink5K) in ~1,980 MoTrPAC participants undergoing ET to identify\ncirculating proteins related to baseline VO2max and VO2max leveraging the non-exercise control arm in\nMoTrPAC. In Aim 2 we will: A) identify locally-acting (cis-) genetic instruments related to plasma proteins from\nAim 1 (cis-protein quantitative trait loci, pQTLs) from existing, publicly available datasets (TOPMed, UK\nBioBank) as well as generate new cis-pQTLs using WGS from MoTrPAC; and B) gain functional insights into\nthe genetic regulation of VO2max-related proteins through colocalization with tissue expression in GTEx\n(expression- or eQTLs). These experiments will help determine whether a plasma protein is regulated at the\ntranscriptional level and/or in tissues relevant to VO2max (e.g. heart, skeletal muscle) and set the stage for\nfurther mechanistic studies that extend beyond the scope of this project.","project_title":"Integrative analysis of genomics and proteomics to identify candidate molecular transducers of cardiorespiratory fitness","phr_text":"Project Narrative\nCardiorespiratory fitness (CRF) is an integrative measure of cardiopulmonary and metabolic health and\nindependent predictor of long-term survival that can be improved with exercise training.

children, yet very few drugs are specifically\nlabeled for pediatric malignancies, underscoring a need to identify novel molecular therapeutic targets to\nimprove outcomes for children with cancer, which is our long-term goal. Specifically, diffuse pediatric high-\ngrade gliomas (pHGGs) are resistant to multi-modal treatment and have had no new FDA-approved drugs in\nthe past 20 years, thus patients with these tumors are in urgent need of novel, effective therapeutic strategies.\nAberrant splicing contributes to neoepitope formation and represents a class of untapped targetable genetic\nalterations that are largely unexplored in pHGG. Our central hypothesis of this research plan is that aberrant\nsplicing events can result in tumor-specific neoepitopes in pHGGs and these data can be rapidly harnessed\nand prioritized for therapeutic targeting. The proposed work will test this hypothesis with two integrated specific\naims: 1) identify putative immunotherapeutic subtype-specific splice targets in pHGGs and 2) characterize\naberrant splice variation in pHGG preclinical models and validate immunotherapeutic splice targets for\npreclinical testing. These studies will integrate transcriptional splice events with tumor tissue expression (PBTA\nand Kids First X01), normal tissue expression (GTEx and available pediatric matched tissue normals), peptide\nsequences (UniProt), and known extracellular domain annotations (UniProt) to identify and prioritize\nneoepitopes generated in pHGGs. This work will elucidate novel splice-driven immunotherapeutic targets\nthrough rigorous integrative computational analysis of splice variation in pHGG tumors, coupled with\northogonal molecular assays, to validate presence and expression of these targets. The successful completion\nof this project will generate significant new knowledge of aberrant splicing programs in pHGG and will identify\npotential immunotherapeutic targets. This work is critical to understanding the genetic contributions of aberrant\nsplicing to pediatric cancer, will enable the research and clinical communities to rationally inform novel\nimmunotherapeutic strategies for pHGG, and will serve as a roadmap for investigation of neoepitopes in other\npediatric brain tumors. This work is highly relevant to the critical mission of the National Cancer Institute to\nadvance scientific knowledge and identify novel strategies to improve overall survival of cancer patients.","project_title":"Discovery of neoepitope immunotherapeutic targets in diffuse pediatric high-grade gliomas","phr_text":"Project Narrative\nPediatric diffuse high-grade gliomas are the leading cause of death by central nervous system tumor and are in\nurgent need of novel therapies.

This gap of knowledge delays the progress in risk assessment and therapeutic\nstrategies for sex-aware precision healthcare. While studies have shown significant sex\ndifferences in the genetic architectures of complex diseases, most investigators opted to do sex-\ncombined analyses in disease genetic studies to maximize statistical power. NIH recently began\nto reinforce the inclusion of sex as a biological variable in the design, analysis, and reporting of\nvertebrate animal and human studies. Insights into the functional genetic bases of sex as a\nbiological variable are critical to develop therapeutic interventions that equally benefit each sex.\nWe recently found that ~1% variants in the population have sex-biased allele frequency, including\n~10% of disease variants in the Genome Aggregation Database (gnomAD). These variants\npreferentially occur in tissue-specific sex-differentially expressed genes. We propose a novel\napproach to study sex differences in disease genetic architectures by leveraging variants that are\nsex-biased either in allele frequency or phenotypic association. We believe this approach will\nincrease the statistical power to identify sex-specific or sex interacting causal variants in sex-\nbiased diseases. We will identify and characterize sex-biased variants in gnomAD, Genotype-\nTissue Expression project (GTEx) and Trans-Omics for Precision Medicine for sleep disordered\nbreathing phenotypes and venous thromboembolism case-control datasets. We will subsequently\nstudy the functional mechanisms of these sex-biased variants in ~50 GTEx tissues. The\ncompletion of this pilot study will advance future genetic studies of sex-divergent disorders and\naccelerate the realization of sex-aware genomic medicine.","project_title":"Using GTEx to assess the functionality of sex-biased variants","phr_text":"PROJECT NARRATIVE\nSex differences in human diseases are common, but they are not well understood.

Precision Health (NPH), and the Human\nHealth Exposure Analysis Resource (HHEAR) are NIH-funded national projects (three originating from NIH\nCommon Fund initiatives) that measure thousands of metabolites in large cohorts of human subjects under\nexercise, diet, environmental exposure conditions respectively. The Common Fund initiated Metabolomics\nWorkbench, which serves as the data repository, the metabolomics harmonization center and the data analytics\nworkbench for deep analyses of human metabolomics and provides the infrastructure to develop the concept of\nhuman metabotype. We characterize the metabolomic state of groups of individuals with common homeostatic\npoints for a collection of metabolites as “human metabotypes”. More precisely, the metabotype defines a\ncollection of metabolites or metabolite classes that is unique (in the metabolomic hyperspace) to a class of\nindividuals – defined in this project through metabolomics measurements from humans subject to exercise and\ndiet perturbations and humans subject to distinct environmental exposures. Human subjects can be classified\nas belonging to one of several distinct groups (e.g., clusters in a UMAP) defining the metabotype for a chosen\nset of metabolites in a class. At the quantitative level, the distinct groups are defined by distinct profiles of\nmetabolites or metabolite classes.\nThe major goal of this project is to use the three national projects to develop the “metabotype” concept into a\nconcrete set of points in the metabolomics hyperspace that define the human physiological state. Towards this,\nwe harmonize the metabolomics data across the national projects, identify the clusters of metabolites/metabolite\nclasses that define a group of human subjects, and provide the biological context to the metabotype. The tools\nwe will develop will enable an end user to analyze and decipher the physiological function that further defines\nthe metabotype and explore perturbations such as exercise, diet, or changing environment to see how the\nhomeostatic endotype points change into another possible homeostatic state.\nMost importantly, given that the definition of the endotypes in the MoTrPAC, NPH and HHEAR projects largely\nrefer to healthy human subjects, we will develop the ability for any individual with their metabolomic\nmeasurements to map their data on the metabotype space. Using such a “Metabotype Calculator”, the most\nvaluable product of this project, a human subject will be able to assess their “state of health” and assess how\nperturbations such as exercise or diet will alter their homeostatic metabotype states. We anticipate that the\n“Metabotype Calculator” will serve as a dynamic living counterpart to the genotype in defining the human\nsubject’s state of physiology. All the resources developed in this project will be available on the Common Fund\nData Ecosystem Data Repository Center (CFDE DRC).

We will import germline and genomics data from affected\ncohorts into the Common Fund Data Ecosystem (CFDE) Data Distillery Knowledge Graph (DDKG) project, an\nongoing CFDE project that generated a comprehensively annotated graph database built with empirical data\nfrom 11 Common Fund projects with over 40 million data points and 300 million relationships, and which utility\nhas been proven through successful applications of several complex use cases.\nOur goals for this proposal are first to expand and update the DDKG schema to support a broader spectrum of\ngenomic data types and edge (relationship) weighting by evidence level. This expansion will expand the DDKG’s\ninformation capacity and better support machine learning applications on extracted data. Datasets chosen from\nthis project are based on epidemiological observations on the relationships between congenital heart defects\nand neuroblastoma or hematological malignancies, and brain or CNS congenital defects and brain tumors. Data\nfrom representative cohorts with any or both selected CCs and SBDs will be obtained from the Kids First project\nas germline and tumor data. We will also incorporate genomics data from the NCI Molecular Targets Project into\nthe DDKG, representing a comprehensive repository of childhood cancer genomics data produced by the lead\nprincipal investigator.\nWe will analyze the DDKG data for predicted relationships between SBDs and CCs with strategies including\ntopological link prediction methods, the Connect the Dots algorithm, dimensionality reduction methods (such as\nembeddings) with cluster detection, and machine learning with PyG’s support for Graph Neural Networks (GNNs)\nfor heterogeneous graphs. User data delivery will be accomplished with the DDKG project’s pre-built tools, and\nby developing and refining innovative data delivery methods. This will enhance the accessibility of the project's\nfindings and extend the utility of the DDKG for the broader research community.\nWith the analysis of large-scale pediatric cohort genomics data, we seek to set a precedent for large-scale\ngenomics data analyses using Common Fund Data while providing significant insights into the genetic drivers of\nCCs and SBDs, paving the way for future research and clinical applications. Other researchers can utilize the\nDDKG with our methodology developments, increasing the opportunities to reuse CFDE data.","project_title":"U24-Uncovering the Shared Genetic Origins of Childhood Cancer and Structural Birth Defects Through Enhanced Data Integration and Analysis with the CFDE Data Distillery Knowledge Graph.","phr_text":"Project Narra+ve\nThe research proposed in this project aims to signiﬁcantly enhance our understanding of the\ngene7c links between childhood cancers and structural birth defects, which are among the\nleading causes of pediatric morbidity and mortality.

This study will focus on analysis of oral-facial clefts, congenital diaphragmatic\nhernia, and congenital heart defects from whole-genome sequencing (WGS) data from family cohorts taken\nfrom Gabriella Miller Kids First Pediatric Research Project (KF).\n Typically, tests to link disorders to genome-wide complex multivariate associations are computationally\nprohibitive. Thus, a first step to making such analyses more reasonable is to limit the number of variables\n(genes, variants) being tested together. We can reduce the number of possible tests by restricting what data\nshould be tested. This study will seek to reduce the data for testing by utilizing biological knowledge from other\ntwo Common Fund datasets: the Knockout Mouse Phenotyping Program (KOMP2), and the Genotype-Tissue\nExpression (GTEx) project. KOMP2 has generated extensive information on mouse knockout developmental\nphenotypes relevant for matching gene and phenotypes in KF WGS studies. GTEx can be merged with KF loci\nand relevant tissue-to-phenotype relationships. Thus, using features from other Common Fund data and\nannotations, we can generate selected subsets of KF variants and genes as feature-reduced KF data.\n A comprehensive machine learning (ML) analysis pipeline will then be utilized for the identification of\ncandidate risk factors and characterization of complex patterns of association between these feature-reduced\nKF data. In addition to performing the more traditional univariate association analyses of genotype vs.\nphenotype, this pipeline will also identify complex associations including (1) context-dependent genetic effects\nresulting from non-additive multi-variant interactions, i.e. epistasis, and (2) subgroup-specific associations, i.e.\nby phenotype and genotypic heterogeneity, where different etiological paths lead to the same/similar\nphenotypes in the selected KF subject group. This pipeline will include feature selection, modeling, and\ninterpretation of multi-variant interactions.\n The outcomes of this study will include (1) pipelines for integrating Common Fund data into Kids First\ndatasets, (2) integrated KF-KOMP2-GTEx datasets including cross-species integration, (3) ML pipelines for\nmulti-variant interaction analyses of phenotype vs genotype in selected, reduced-feature KF data, and (4) results\nfrom the aforementioned pipelines for multi-variant interactions for later hypothesis testing.","project_title":"Leveraging Common Fund data for feature selection in Kids First studies.","phr_text":"Project Abstract\nThis project will pilot a process for identifying interactions between genetic variants that contribute to\nstructural birth defect and childhood cancer disorders by combining data from the Gabriella Miller Kids First\nPediatric Research Project with biological knowledge from other two Common Fund datasets: the Knockout\nMouse Phenotyping Program (KOMP2), and the Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx) project.

While there are two major types of lung cancer (i.e., 80%~85% for non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC)\nand 10%~15% for small cell lung cancer (SCLC)), each type of lung cancer has multiple distinct subtypes\ncharacterized by morphological, molecular, and genetic alterations. Identifying lung cancer subtypes can\nfacilitate downstream risk stratification and tailored treatment design. While various conventional methods like\nmorphological analysis, computed tomography (CT) and imaging techniques, cytogenetic analysis,\nimmunophenotyping, or molecular profiling have been used for lung cancer subtype identification, they are\nusually costly, time-consuming, labor-intensive, and sometimes inaccurate. Recent progress has witnessed the\napplication of next generation sequencing (NGS) for identifying lung cancer subtypes, but they are limited to bulk\nNGS data, or single omics data only. With tons of omics data being generated within and beyond the Common\nFund data sets (e.g., GTEx and HuBMAP), we hypothesize that integration of single-cell and bulk multi-omics\ndata including genomics, transcriptomics, and epigenetics data will significantly facilitate subtype-specific\nbiomarker discovery and boost the accuracy of lung cancer subtype identification. To address these concerns,\nwe propose to develop an integrated machine learning (ML) framework for accurate and cost-effective\nlung cancer subtype identification by combining single-cell and bulk multi-omics data within and beyond\nCommon Fund data sets. To achieve this, two specific aims are undertaken. Aim 1, to establish a gene-\nsignature-transfer ML model that leverages large-scale bulk and single-cell transcriptomics data within and\nbeyond Common Fund data sets for lung cancer subtype identification. Besides identifying well-annotated lung\ncancer subtypes, we will also explore novel lung cancer subtypes by detecting rare cell types from large-scale\nsingle cell data, from which cluster-specific and rare-cell-type specific gene signatures can be transferred to the\nbulk transcriptomics data for improving performance of lung cancer subtype identification. Aim 2, to develop a\nmulti-omics integration framework to systematically combine single-cell and bulk multi-omics data (including\ngenomics, transcriptomics, epigenomics) to further boost lung cancer subtype identification. Our model is flexible\nto tackle cases when only partial or incomplete multi-omics data are available for new patients. We believe\nsuccessful completion of this study will have direct impacts on improving downstream lung cancer risk\nstratification, facilitating diagnosis and prognosis, and optimizing treatment selection. We also expect that our\nproposed framework in this study can be customized and extensible to identifying subtypes of other types of\ncancer.","project_title":"Leveraging Heterogenous Common Fund Data Sets and Beyond for Identifying Lung Cancer Subtypes","phr_text":"Project Narrative\nIn this project, we propose to develop an accurate and cost-effective machine learning framework for lung cancer\nsubtype identification by integrating multi-modal genomics data within and beyond the Common Fund data sets.\nIf successful, our study will directly improve downstream lung cancer diagnosis, prognosis, and treatment.

Traditionally, research in this field has heavily relied on transcriptome\ndata and machine learning to infer these networks, but this approach has mostly used bulk tissue samples. This\nmethod overlooks the nuances of individual cells and their microenvironments, limiting our understanding to a\nbroader, macroscopic level.\nThe advent of spatial transcriptomics marks a significant shift, promising to unravel these networks at a single-\ncell and spatial level. This technology allows for the exploration of gene expression in relation to spatial dynamics,\nenhancing our understanding of tissue organization and cellular functions.\nHowever, adapting machine learning to spatial genomics faces challenges. One major issue is the scarcity of\nspatial transcriptome data, which hampers the effectiveness of deep learning methods known for their superiority\nin network estimation. Another challenge is the need for models that account for the physical positions of cells,\nas traditional methods treat data as independent and identically distributed, ignoring spatial relationships.\nTo address these challenges, this proposal outlines two main objectives:\nAim 1: Developing deep learning methods for cell-type resolution regulatory network estimation capable\nof transferring between scRNA-seq and spatial transcriptomics data. We will develop machine learning\nmdoels that can integrate components that explicitly model the regulatory network, distinguishing cell types\nbased on transcriptomic data. The approach will use domain-invariant regularization to adapt from scRNA-seq\nto spatial transcriptomics, employing GTEx and HuBMap data sets.\nAim 2: Developing deep learning methods with spatial regularization for estimating regulatory networks\nat spatial resolution within spatial transcriptomics. We will develop techniques that factor in the spatial\npositioning of cells during the learning process. The hypothesis is that cells in close spatial proximity have similar\nregulatory structures. This aim will also use GTEx and HuBMap data, along with collaborative efforts on spatial\ntranscriptome data of the human dorsolateral prefrontal cortex.\nOverall, this proposal seeks to lead the development of advanced deep learning models, integrating cell-type\nresolution and spatial dimensions to revolutionize our understanding of regulatory networks in genomics to both\nthe cell-type and spatial resolution.","project_title":"Toward Deep Learning Techniques for Cell-Type and Spatial Resolution Estimation of Regulatory Networks","phr_text":"This proposal aims to advance the understanding of gene regulatory networks in genomics by developing deep\nlearning models that integrate spatial transcriptomics data.

project (GTEx) collected whole-genome sequencing and\ngene expression data from 47 tissues sites of hundreds of subjects. It generated a huge impact by providing\ntissue-level gene expression and expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs) for over 7,000 publications. However,\ntissues are mixtures of myriad cells, and tissue-level gene regulation is affected by cellular compositions. To\nobtain cell-type-specific (CTS) effects, GTEx started to collect single-nucleus RNA-sequencing (snRNA-seq)\ndata from eight tissue types. The single-cell data collection is extremely expensive and labor-intensive, and thus\nsnRNA-seq data are only collected from 25 tissue samples of 16 donors that may not represent the population.\nMore cost and labor-efficient methods are urgently needed to use existing datasets fully. It turns out that with\nanother NIH Common Fund project, Human BioMolecular Atlas Program (HuBMAP), we can gain population-\nlevel insights with HuBMAP single-cell data as a reference by developing computationally efficient\nmethods. Complementary to GTEx and other single-cell references, the HuBMAP single-cell reference\nallows us to deconvolve the 47 GTEx tissues into over 200 cell types. In addition to the cellular fractions, we\nwill calculate CTS eQTLs for those cell types at a population scale. Specifically, we will: 1) estimate cellular\nfractions of over 200 cell types from 47 tissue sites across the human body; 2) calculate CTS-eQTLs for those\nhundreds of cell types with statistical rigor and power. We will further consider the potential selection bias in\nthe eQTL analysis that GTEx collected only normal tissues. The successful completion of this project will\nmaximize the usage of NIH Common Fund GTEx and HuBMAP projects to provide a new eQTL resource at\ncell-type resolution. It will be powerful in downstream analyses such as CTS colocalization by connecting with\ngenome-wide association studies (GWAS) and CTS transcriptome-wide association studies (TWAS) by\npredicting genetically regulated CTS gene expression. Altogether, this project will provide a global picture of\nthe human body at high resolution to map cells to health and complex diseases.","project_title":"Integration of GTEx and HuBMAP data to gain population-level cell-type-specific insights","phr_text":"PROJECT NARRATIVE\nNIH Common Fund programs collected huge amounts of data that need to be efficiently used.

greatly\nimproving our understanding of the genetic origins of complex diseases. A large number of variants have been\nassociated with individual traits, but a complete understanding of complex disease remains elusive, due in\nlarge part to two unsolved challenges. First, a majority of associated variants are noncoding and distant from\nthe nearest gene, complicating their interpretation. Second, the observed heritability of many complex diseases\nfar exceeds the portion which can be explained by GWAS-discovered variants, largely because of the\ncombined effects of rare variants unprobed by current techniques and common variants falling below\nsignificance thresholds of existing GWAS methods. As whole-genome sequencing and rare variant discovery\nbecome increasingly prevalent, frameworks for functionally annotating rare variants and associating them with\ndisease-associated driver genes and pathways will become increasingly important. A wealth of public\nepigenetic data exists, including collections of chromatin modification profiles and 3D structure data from\nvarious Common Fund sources as well as external consortia. In combination with whole-genome sequencing\ndata, these datasets offer great potential to further our understanding of diseases across the spectrum from\nMendelian to complex diseases.\nAs members of the ENCODE Project, we have developed the Registry of candidate cis-Regulatory Elements\n(cCREs), a collection of nearly a million candidate enhancers, promoters, and insulators in the human genome\nwith activity profiles in more than 800 human cell types. In parallel, we collaborated with Prof. Xihong Lin on\nthe development of variant-Set Test for Association using Annotation infoRmation (STAAR), a framework for\nperforming rare-variant association tests using functional annotations and a dynamic weighting scheme. Here\nwe aim to extend the Registry of cCREs to include gene regulatory networks, including gene-enhancer links,\n3D chromatin neighborhoods, co-expressed gene networks, and biochemical pathways, drawing on data from\nthe Common Fund, including GTEx and the 4DNucleome Project, and other public sources (Aim 1). We then\naim to extend GWAS and the STAAR methodology to incorporate these higher-order features to identify novel\ngene regulatory network associations with disease-associated rare variants (Aim 2). In this study, we will focus\non three human congenital disorders, cleft lip/palate (CLP), congenital diaphragmatic hernia (CDH), and\nventricular septal defect (VSD), as these disorders have extensive whole-genome sequencing data by the\nGabriella Miller Kids First Pediatric Research Consortium. We will validate our results using Knockout Mouse\nPhenotyping Program (KOMP2). In summary, we will discover new disease-gene associations, produce a\nframework broadly applicable to existing and future whole-genome sequencing datasets, and improve the\nutility and accessibility of four select Common Fund datasets (GTEx, 4DNucleome, KOMP2, and Kids First).","project_title":"Constructing multi-omics regulatory networks for functional variant annotation","phr_text":"PROJECT NARRATIVE\nGenome-wide association studies are increasingly moving toward rare variant discovery and whole-genome\nsequencing in order to discover sources of missing heritability and identify novel genetic contributors to\ncomplex diseases, and computational frameworks for functionally annotating rare variants will be critical to\nderive meaningful biological findings from these datasets as they are produced. We propose to build upon our\nexisting computational methods and resources, integrating the wealth of Common Fund and public genomic\nand epigenomic data to develop a comprehensive, novel framework for linking rare variants with gene\nregulatory networks. We will pilot this framework by analyzing datasets for three congenital human disorders\nfrom the Kids First collection, aiming to discover novel gene regulatory associations with these disorders

inner life of the cell.\nAs a hub for knowledge of protein sequence and function, UniProt organizes knowledge from biomedical\nliterature, integrates datasets with curated knowledge, and serves as an exemplar FAIR and TRUST resource\nreused by hundreds of other data resources. The Common Fund (CF) program brings together diverse\ncollections of valuable biomedical data, yet still needs to be connected with the major data repositories\necosystem to uncover its full potential for discovery and innovation. In this application we will strengthen the\nprotein-centric connectivity of UniProt to multiple CF Data Coordinating Centers (DCCs) and the Data Resource\nCenter (DRC) in the Common Fund Data Ecosystem (CFDE), and will collaborate with two CF DCCs, the\nKnockout Mouse Phenotyping Program (KOMP2) and the Cell Maps for AI (CM4AI) Project of the Bridge to\nArtificial Intelligence (Bridge2AI) Program. The collaboration will support CFDE data integration and reuse, while\nbuilding new capabilities to interrogate and understand complex biological systems and cell networks for deeper\nunderstanding of responses to perturbations at the systems level. To foster biomedical discovery through the re-\nuse of CF data and enable novel scientific research that was not possible before, we will increase the connectivity\nand data integration between UniProt and CF datasets. We will create a new form-based mechanism to link with\nCF data resources, starting with several already identified for targeted integration. We will extend the UniProt\nmapping service, allowing researchers to identify data of interest through protein-centric search and promote\ninteroperability at the protein level across the CF ecosystem. We will develop new tools, APIs and workflows\nwith easy access and navigation for researchers to interrogate and understand complex biological systems and\ncell networks. It will allow seamless bidirectional navigation of data from whole subcellular systems to functional\npathways and interacting proteins and vice versa. We will hold annual workshops to broaden collaborations with\nthe CFDE and engagement with the research community. We will incorporate user feedback throughout the tool\ndevelopment lifecycle and implement an integration plan with the CFDE for dissemination and long-term\nsustainability. We aim to understand systems-level responses to perturbations through genotype-phenotype\nmapping and metabolic and signaling network discovery. We will integrate relevant datasets, tools, and literature\nand extend our knowledge graph learning algorithm for link prediction in a drug discovery use case. We will build\ncustomized knowledge graphs with various use scenarios, incorporating scientific questions from the\ndemonstration project and user engagement.

Moreover, this deep neural network model enables high-\nthroughput in silico genetic screen (ISGS) for identifying cell type-specific DNA elements that are important for\nchromatin interactions. To fully unlock the discovery potential of this deep neural network-based ISGS approach,\nhere we propose to leverage the NIH Common Fund-supported large-scale genomic data across human bio-\nsamples for discovering novel regulators in 3D genome organization.

To identify the expression\nquantitative trait loci (eQTLs) of each gene, the genetic variants within one million base pairs (1\nMb) of the transcription start site (TSS) of the gene are considered as the candidates, and then\nthe GTEx computational pipeline identifies the significant candidates as eQTLs of the gene. This\n1 Mb threshold is being widely used as the gold standard in the field to reduce multiple tests.\nUsing this threshold assumes that genetic variants outside of this distance contribute little to\ngene expression, and thus are unlikely to be eQTLs. However, we observed that, on average,\n10% of cis-regulatory elements (CREs) are outside of the 1 Mb threshold, herein referred to as\ndistal CREs. Therefore, the eQTLs in such CREs are missed using the 1 Mb threshold. In\naddition, the 1 Mb threshold implicitly assumes that the majority of genomic regions within the\ndistance to a TSS are CREs that regulate the gene. However, we found that on average CREs\naccount for only 2.1% of the ±1Mb regions around a TSS. Moreover, it is not uncommon that\nCREs skip the closest genes to regulate distal genes. These observations indicate that many\ncandidate variants within the 1 Mb distance may be noise, and thus impede the detection of\nbona fide eQTLs. In line with this, we found that using distance thresholds smaller than 1 Mb\nsubstantially increase the numbers of eQTLs and associated genes. These results together\nindicate that the current eQTLs detection can be improved by focusing only on the CREs of\ngenes. To this end, we will use the genome structure data from 4D Nucleome and other public\ndata to build CRE-gene linkages. These linkages are expected to detect more eQTLs,\nespecially the weak ones. The results will enhance the existing GTEx dataset and substantially\nimprove our understanding of gene expression regulation and human diseases.","project_title":"Using three-dimensional genome structure to refine eQTL detection","phr_text":"PROJECT NARRATIVE:\nThis project aims to use the linkages between cis-regulatory elements (CREs) and their\ntarget genes to improve the identification of expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs) in the\nGenotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx) program.

We will use single cell/nucleus RNA-\nsequencing (scRNA-seq) data from the Common Fund-supported Human BioMolecular Atlas Program (HuBMAP)\nand Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx) consortia to prototype a cell type harmonization protocol for\nconstructing a cross-consortia cell census meta-atlas. The HuBMAP consortium provides organ-specific cell\natlases for multiple organs, while GTEx provides an integrated cross-organ single cell atlas. Our group has\ndeveloped and extensively validated computational algorithms, NS-Forest and FR-Match, for biomarker\nidentification and robust cell type matching using scRNA-seq data. Our algorithms utilize Random Forest\nmachine learning and minimum spanning tree graphical modeling, which provide superior classification\nperformance while maintaining high explainability and interpretability for biological applications. In Specific Aim\n1, rigorous data quality control approaches will be applied for dataset selection and preparation. The NS-Forest\nalgorithm will then be used to identify optimal biomarker combinations for characterization of organ-specific cell\ntypes of individual organs in HuBMAP and cross-organ cell types in GTEx. In Specific Aim 2, we will focus on\nhuman lung, as an exemplar organ, to prototype the assembly of a cross-consortia meta-atlas by developing a\nrobust cell type harmonization approach using our validated and benchmarked FR-Match algorithm and\nHuBMAP-Lung, GTEx lung subset, and other publicly available Human Lung Cell Atlas (HLCA) datasets. We\nwill compare and benchmark FR-Match with two other popular methods, Azimuth and CellTypist, for cell type\nmatching and validate the matching results using all methods. We will also form a domain expert panel to review\nand validate the cell type harmonization results using domain knowledge and literature information for community\napproval. We will build a strategy for capturing sample metadata, anatomic structure information, cell type\nnomenclature and biomarker-based definitions into an ontological representation for the meta-atlas and populate\nthe contents into the Provisional Cell Ontology. In Specific Aim 3, we will disseminate our results to key\nstakeholder communities, including the HuBMAP Anatomical Structures, Cell Types and Biomarkers (ASCT+B)\nWorking Group and the GTEx Multi-Gene Single Cell Query platform.

computational methods to leverage diverse sources of data sets, including the\nrich information generated from the NIH Common Fund projects, for drug repurposing, which may dramatically\nlower the

With the advancement of high-throughput sequencing and massively parallel technologies, more\nand more omics data are available for biomedical research. These genomics, transcriptomics, proteomics,\nmetabolomics and microbiomics data can help biomedical researchers better understand the complex\nbiological systems underlying human diseases from different perspectives. For example, genome-wide\nassociation and sequencing studies have successfully identified tens of thousands of variants that are\nsignificantly associated with one or more complex traits. Despite these great successes, the results have not\nbeen fully translated into potential clinical value. The overall goal of this pilot project is to leverage the rich\ninformation generated from the NIH Common Funds projects, in combination of other public data sets, to\nexplore the feasibility of drug repurposing through novel computational approaches. The ultimate goal of our\nproject is to develop, implement, and apply a computational framework to integrate data from the Common\nFund projects and other resources to identify potential uses of existing drugs for new indications, and we will\nalso make our newly developed tools available to the general research community. This will be accomplished\nthrough: [1] further development of a powerful framework proposed by our group to leverage cross-tissue\ninformation in the GTEx data to achieve higher accuracy in imputation of gene expression within each tissue\nand combine single-tissue association tests to derive a powerful test for gene-trait association using summary\nstatistics from genome wide association studies; [2] development of a signature-matching-based drug\nrepurposing framework with gene expression data from diverse sources (drug perturbation experiments, case\ncontrol studies, and patient intervention studies) and GWAS summary statistics; and [3] implementation and\napplication of the proposed framework to discover candidate drugs for repurposing to diseases in critical need\nof drug development, e.g. non-alcoholic steatohepatitis.

In\ncontrast to adult cancer with many genetic mutations, most pediatric cancers have few genetic mutations. Instead,\nrecent studies have shown that fusion RNAs and their encoded proteins may drive tumorigenesis in children.\nFusion RNAs are generated by exons from two genes. With the launch of the Fusion Oncoproteins in Childhood\nCancers Consortium, more fusion proteins are being found and studied. However, a complete understanding of\nthe mechanisms in pediatric cancer remains elusive, mainly due to three unsolved challenges. First, current\nstudies have focused on mRNA-derived fusion proteins and have not explored long noncoding RNA-derived\nfusion transcripts (lnc-fusions) and their encoded proteins in pediatric cancer; although lnc-fusions have been\nreported in adult cancer to regulate anti-tumor immunity. long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) are long transcripts\nof at least 200 nucleotides that cannot encode protein. lncRNAs largely outnumber mRNAs and play critical roles\nin various cancers. Therefore, a complete investigation of mechanisms driving pediatric cancer is not possible\nwithout expanding the study of fusion proteins to include lncRNA-fusions. Second, existing lnc-fusion detection\nmethods cannot explore lnc-fusions that are derived from novel lncRNAs. Due to high disease-specificity, most\nlncRNAs have not been annotated in pediatric cancer. Third, fusion RNAs, including lnc-fusions, may be formed\nby alternative mechanisms, such as chromosome rearrangement or aberrant splicing events. These alternative\nmechanisms complicate the understanding of genetic mechanisms and thus treatment.\n The large amount of multi-omics data from various Common Fund sources enables us to address these\nchallenges in pediatric cancer. Previously, we had developed computational methods to identify and characterize\nlncRNAs for human diseases and development. To discover molecular drivers in pediatric cancer, we will extend\nour previous studies of lncRNAs to identify lnc-fusions from RNA sequencing data (Aim 1). We will further\ndetermine the potential functions and formation mechanisms of lnc-fusions using integrative methods (Aim 2).\nMachine learning algorithms will be used to identify lnc-fusions as putative biomarkers and prognostic biomarkers\nin pediatric cancers.\n This study will focus on neuroblastoma and myeloid malignancies since these pediatric cancers have\nlarge cohorts of RNA sequencing and whole-genome sequencing data in the Gabriella Miller Kids First Dataset.\n In summary, we will discover lnc-fusions in pediatric cancers, develop computational methods and\nframeworks broadly applicable to existing and future RNA sequencing datasets. This study will improve the utility\nof three selected Common Fund datasets (Kids First, GTEx and 4DNucleome), and two external databases\n(GEO and TCGA).","project_title":"Integrative analysis of multi-omics data to identify and characterize long noncoding RNA-derived fusions in pediatric cancer","phr_text":"Fusion RNAs and their encoded proteins are widely found in various cancers and have been\nused as biomarkers and therapeutic targets for multiple cancers.

We propose to\npromote the integration and widen the usage of selected Common Fund data sets (KidsFirst, GTEx, and\nLINCS L1000) using UCSC Xena. UCSC Xena is a web-based high-performance resource for functional\ngenomics data visualization with a large user base in the cancer genomics research community. Xena is\nalready a visualization resource for a Common Fund data set, the GTEx transcriptome, which cancer\nresearchers can use to compare gene expression between tumors and matched normal tissues. Our proposed\nwork will further widen the usage of the Common Fund data sets by providing the scientific community a\nweb-based interactive avenue to visualize and explore the data. We also propose to integrate the data with\nother cancer genomics data for pan-cancer across-tissue comparison to identify target genes and pathways in\npatients tumors. Lastly our proposal will extend Xena Browser software functionality to use differential gene\nexpression and leverage external tools and APIs to search for small molecules that might inhibit tumor growth.\nWe propose the following aims. Aim 1. We will add KidsFirst data to Xena and integrate it with the cancer\ngenomics data already on Xena to enable comparative visualization of molecular profiles across pediatric and\nadult tumors. Aim 2. Building upon the success of the UCSC RNA-seq compendium, we will deliver an even\nlarger uniformly analyzed RNA-seq data compendium of over 25,0000 samples from KidsFirst, GTEx, TCGA,\nTARGET, CCLE and other studies. We will openly-share the compendium data using the Xena Browser. This\nrich data resource will support not only users wishing to compare expression across tumor to normal tissues,\nbut will also support the Treehouse Childhood Cancer initiative in their quest to find treatments for children with\ncancer. Aim 3. We will extend Xena software functionality to perform genome-wide differential gene\nexpression analysis and connect the analysis results to L1000FWD, a state-of-the-art web-based search and\nvisualization tool for tens of thousands of small-molecule perturbation signatures profiled by the LINCS L1000\nassay. This new feature and connectivity will enable users to predict candidate small molecule perturbations\nthat might disrupt tumor growth using the reverse tumor gene expression signature they identified on Xena.","project_title":"Use UCSC Xena to promote integration and usage of the KidsFirst, GTEx, and LINCS L1000 data sets","phr_text":"PROJECT NARRATIVE\nSeveral valuable and widely available data sets have been generated by multiple Common Fund programs.\nLeveraging UCSC Xena, we will provide a web-based interactive data visualization and exploration platform to\npromote the usage and integration of the KidsFirst, GTEx and LINCS L1000 data sets with cancer genomics\ndata to identify target genes and pathways in patients tumors, and predict candidate small molecule\nperturbations that might inhibit tumor growth.","spending_categories_desc":"Biotechnology; Cancer; Cancer Genomics; Genetics; Human Genome; Networking and Information Technology R&D
